12/01/2016, 23:08 - Munjaal: Lengthy, and useless
12/01/2016, 23:10 - Dhaani: Oh come on
12/01/2016, 23:11 - Munjaal: Well I don't feel like coming to the college. It's a waste of time tbh
13/01/2016, 00:53 - Dhaani: 😐
17/01/2016, 23:10 - Munjaal: Hola

17/01/2016, 23:10 - Dhaani: I forgot to ask, how did you get my number?
17/01/2016, 23:11 - Dhaani: Not much. On my way home from a painful evening. But it'll take a while.
17/01/2016, 23:11 - Munjaal: magic 💫
17/01/2016, 23:12 - Dhaani: 😒
17/01/2016, 23:12 - Munjaal: 😂
17/01/2016, 23:14 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
17/01/2016, 23:15 - Dhaani: 😒
17/01/2016, 23:17 - Munjaal: 🤔
17/01/2016, 23:18 - Dhaani: 😒
17/01/2016, 23:18 - Munjaal: 😐
17/01/2016, 23:18 - Dhaani: Just tell me.
17/01/2016, 23:19 - Munjaal: I asked Dhenuka
17/01/2016, 23:19 - Munjaal: But why so serious
17/01/2016, 23:19 - Dhaani: I am on my way home from an annoying wedding.
17/01/2016, 23:19 - Dhaani: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=19.2498902,73.1417224
17/01/2016, 23:19 - Dhaani: It'll take a while.
17/01/2016, 23:20 - Munjaal: Well that's quite far 😅
17/01/2016, 23:20 - Dhaani: And my footwear broke because the lawn was wet enough that the heel kept sinking into the mud. 😓
17/01/2016, 23:20 - Munjaal: ROFL XD
17/01/2016, 23:20 - Dhaani: And I knew almost no one.
17/01/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: I'm gonna be in the same condition day after tomorrow ✌🏻
17/01/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: Wish me luck
17/01/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: So I spent most of the time walking behind mum and politely smiling at people and eating.
17/01/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: And everyone was taking an estimate about how old I am. Exclamations when I said final year engineering.
17/01/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: That's when Bhabhi reminded me that they're probably calculating whether I am old enough for them to send rishtas.
17/01/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: 😓
17/01/2016, 23:22 - Munjaal: Hahahahahahaha
17/01/2016, 23:23 - Munjaal: #justIndianthings
17/01/2016, 23:23 - Dhaani: 🙈
17/01/2016, 23:24 - Munjaal: Well, at least there's food
17/01/2016, 23:24 - Munjaal: Nobody hates food
17/01/2016, 23:26 - Munjaal: 🍕
17/01/2016, 23:26 - Dhaani: It wasn't great food. And not much variety.
17/01/2016, 23:27 - Dhaani: I wish
17/01/2016, 23:28 - Munjaal: 😞sad

24/01/2016, 14:23 - Munjaal: You had gone to meet your friend ...
24/01/2016, 14:55 - Dhaani: Didnt go finally.
24/01/2016, 14:56 - Dhaani: He called up a couple of times.

02/02/2016, 00:20 - Munjaal: Why am I a 'kid' ?
02/02/2016, 00:20 - Dhaani: I wasn't going to explain.
02/02/2016, 00:20 - Dhaani: And I was thoda out of my mind at the time... Didn't you notice?
02/02/2016, 00:21 - Munjaal: Gate right ?
02/02/2016, 00:22 - Dhaani: Not just. I might have had a mild sugar drop while I was in the workshop.
02/02/2016, 00:22 - Dhaani: You didn't realize I was talking differently?
02/02/2016, 00:25 - Munjaal: Kinda did
02/02/2016, 00:25 - Munjaal: Sugar drop affects mood as well ?
02/02/2016, 00:29 - Dhaani: Yup.
02/02/2016, 00:30 - Munjaal: 😦
02/02/2016, 00:30 - Munjaal: That's sad
02/02/2016, 00:31 - Dhaani: Yesterday was a very very minor one.
02/02/2016, 00:31 - Munjaal: 😧
02/02/2016, 00:32 - Munjaal: There have been major ones ?
02/02/2016, 00:33 - Dhaani: I have fainted.
02/02/2016, 00:33 - Dhaani: Multiple times.
02/02/2016, 00:34 - Munjaal: Carry a glucometer and a sugar jar with you
02/02/2016, 00:34 - Munjaal: ...
02/02/2016, 00:34 - Dhaani: Arre relax.
02/02/2016, 00:34 - Dhaani: Not a big deal.
02/02/2016, 00:34 - Munjaal: 😶
02/02/2016, 00:35 - Dhaani: I've learnt to manage it for the most part now.
02/02/2016, 00:41 - Munjaal: Nice
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Dhaani: And even yesterday, it wasn't too bad. Otherwise others would have noticed too.
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Dhaani: I just forgot to shut up. 😅
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Munjaal: Hmm. True that
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Munjaal: I couldn't really notice much
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Munjaal: Tbh
02/02/2016, 00:42 - Dhaani: That's good then. 😁
02/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: I tried arm wrestling after ages!
02/02/2016, 00:43 - Munjaal: Hahaha
02/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: And I spoke about video games after ages!
02/02/2016, 00:43 - Munjaal: It was fun though ....
02/02/2016, 00:43 - Munjaal: Wasn't it ?

02/02/2016, 00:48 - Munjaal: Ive come to hate this college's attendance policy
02/02/2016, 00:48 - Munjaal: Truly and faithfully
02/02/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: We all do.
02/02/2016, 00:49 - Munjaal: Any workarounds you might know of ?
02/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: If I did, you wouldn't see me so often.
02/02/2016, 00:50 - Munjaal: True that 😅
02/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: I don't want to go!
02/02/2016, 00:53 - Munjaal: hey I needed an opinion
02/02/2016, 00:53 - Dhaani: Bolo
02/02/2016, 00:53 - Munjaal: You gonna be up for a while ?
02/02/2016, 00:53 - Dhaani: Yup, I think so. Not sure. Why?
02/02/2016, 00:54 - Munjaal: It was about a gift I was planing
02/02/2016, 00:54 - Munjaal: I dunno if it's decent or not
02/02/2016, 00:54 - Dhaani: For whom?
02/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: A friend of mine. She's an otaku. Same as Dhenuka
02/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: She a what?
02/02/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: Otaku=people who like anime
02/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: Oh. Cool. Go on.
02/02/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: Have you heard about laser etching/engraving ?
02/02/2016, 00:57 - Dhaani: Of course.
02/02/2016, 00:59 - Munjaal: I'm gonna make a small wooden cube , etch 6 characters she likes on the 6 faces and add a key chain ring to one of the corners
02/02/2016, 00:59 - Dhaani: Sounds amazing.
02/02/2016, 00:59 - Munjaal: Oh and please don't tell anything to Dhenuka
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Dhaani: Of course not.
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Dhaani: It is for Dhenuka, isn't it?
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: Yes and no
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Dhaani: Can I ask you something?
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: Bolo
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Dhaani: Do you have feelings for her?
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Dhaani: Not asking because of the gift.
02/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: for who ?
02/02/2016, 01:01 - Dhaani: Dhenuka
02/02/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: What made you think so ? I'm curious
02/02/2016, 01:01 - Dhaani: Asking because of the way you reacted when we called you a kid yesterday. You seemed a tad bit too indignant ..
02/02/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: I wasn't annoyed, just confused as 'kid' is almost the opposite of what others prefer to call/treat me as
02/02/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: By others I mean everyone
02/02/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: Something new
02/02/2016, 01:03 - Dhaani: Ohh. OK.
02/02/2016, 01:03 - Dhaani: So do you have feelings for her?
02/02/2016, 01:04 - Munjaal: I don't think so
02/02/2016, 01:05 - Dhaani: Hmmm...
02/02/2016, 01:05 - Dhaani: But the gift is for her na?
02/02/2016, 01:05 - Munjaal: Ya, and another friend as well
02/02/2016, 01:05 - Dhaani: Ohh. Nice!
02/02/2016, 01:06 - Dhaani: It's a very sweet gesture.
02/02/2016, 01:06 - Dhaani: Why were you uncertain about it?
02/02/2016, 01:06 - Munjaal: Dunno. I had no idea what kind of a gift would be appropriate for a girl
02/02/2016, 01:07 - Dhaani: This would be a very appreciated gift...
02/02/2016, 01:10 - Munjaal: 😀 looking forward to seeing her reaction
02/02/2016, 01:10 - Dhaani: It will be a reaction worth paying attention to.
02/02/2016, 01:10 - Dhaani: 😊
02/02/2016, 01:10 - Munjaal: 😁
02/02/2016, 01:10 - Dhaani: Anyway, I am sorry I called you a kid. We were just pulling your leg.
02/02/2016, 01:11 - Munjaal: lol, don't apologize, I want offended
02/02/2016, 01:11 - Munjaal: Wasn't*

02/02/2016, 01:14 - Dhaani: 😐
02/02/2016, 01:14 - Dhaani: This week sometime?
02/02/2016, 01:14 - Munjaal: I'm gonna try tomorrow. Fingers crossed
02/02/2016, 01:15 - Dhaani: Hmmm

10/02/2016, 20:51 - Dhaani: That's great
10/02/2016, 20:57 - Munjaal: 😞 the voice is gone...
10/02/2016, 21:06 - Dhaani: I figured you'd be upset about that.
10/02/2016, 21:10 - Dhaani: Don't worry, you have a nice enough voice. And other things going for you... 😜
10/02/2016, 21:10 - Munjaal: Please enlighten me about the other things ..
10/02/2016, 21:11 - Munjaal: 😅
10/02/2016, 21:11 - Dhaani: You look older. You're sweet. Your beard works on you. Honestly, the bald look does too. You have gorgeous eyes.
10/02/2016, 21:52 - Munjaal: 🤐🙃

10/02/2016, 21:59 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
10/02/2016, 21:59 - Dhaani: I can be nice sometimes. Is it really that surprising?
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Dhaani: 😐
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Dhaani: How cruel do I seem?
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Munjaal: Nah nah
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Dhaani: And just being honest, anyway.
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Munjaal: Never said you're cruel lol
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Munjaal: Only scary at times 😜
10/02/2016, 22:00 - Dhaani: Hahaha

10/02/2016, 22:38 - Dhaani: I believe in correction, not punishment. 😇
10/02/2016, 22:39 - Munjaal: 😨 but some people need some good ol bashing
10/02/2016, 22:39 - Dhaani: Of course. That's part of the corrective course.
10/02/2016, 22:39 - Dhaani: It isn't a punishment, just a corrective exercise.
10/02/2016, 22:40 - Munjaal: same thing , different name imo
10/02/2016, 22:40 - Dhaani: You're learning already.

10/02/2016, 22:47 - Dhaani: I will try.
10/02/2016, 22:47 - Munjaal: 😂 we both have faith in your skill
10/02/2016, 22:47 - Dhaani: Hard to do justice with words to people I care about.
10/02/2016, 22:50 - Munjaal: b.t.w , can I go off topic for a while ?
10/02/2016, 22:50 - Dhaani: Of course.

10/02/2016, 22:58 - Dhaani: But when I am more relaxed or in certain moods, I switch to some different music altogether.
10/02/2016, 22:58 - Munjaal: i see
10/02/2016, 22:59 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
10/02/2016, 23:00 - Dhaani: These folders are for when I am really in a different frame of mind.
10/02/2016, 23:00 - Dhaani: 😅
10/02/2016, 23:00 - Dhaani: Then I have moods when I listen to songs from the Maaeri phase. 😁
10/02/2016, 23:00 - Munjaal: 😯
10/02/2016, 23:01 - Dhaani: Then there are soft jazz moods for which I find playlists online.
10/02/2016, 23:01 - Dhaani: Why the face?
10/02/2016, 23:01 - Munjaal: you already listen to qa wide variety
10/02/2016, 23:01 - Dhaani: Really?
10/02/2016, 23:02 - Munjaal: But they're rare
10/02/2016, 23:02 - Dhaani: What's rare?
10/02/2016, 23:02 - Munjaal: I've almost never heard a single I've from your list before
10/02/2016, 23:02 - Munjaal: one
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: Which list? The folders or the playlist screenshots? 😐
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: I assume folders.
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: 😅
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Munjaal: both i guess
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: Sorry.
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: 😐
10/02/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: The folders I got from a friend who is a professional music composer.
10/02/2016, 23:04 - Dhaani: His original compositions are absolutely mind blowing.
10/02/2016, 23:04 - Dhaani: I have a CD but it stopped working. I am supposed to meet him again to get his music.
10/02/2016, 23:04 - Munjaal: whoa !!!
10/02/2016, 23:04 - Munjaal: amazing !

10/02/2016, 23:13 - Dhaani: Listen to who am I
10/02/2016, 23:13 - Dhaani: It is my favorite.
10/02/2016, 23:14 - Munjaal: loading on youtube
10/02/2016, 23:16 - Munjaal: it's deep
10/02/2016, 23:17 - Dhaani: Also, the emotion changes through the song.
10/02/2016, 23:17 - Dhaani: You know?
10/02/2016, 23:17 - Dhaani: And the Rythm changes with it.
10/02/2016, 23:17 - Dhaani: *rythm
10/02/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: Hear it yet?
10/02/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: Me restless!
10/02/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: finished
10/02/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: had to pause in between cause dad called
10/02/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: damn it's deep though
10/02/2016, 23:27 - Dhaani: Yup
10/02/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: heard any of the ones i sent ?
10/02/2016, 23:28 - Dhaani: Nahi. Watching a movie. 😅
10/02/2016, 23:28 - Munjaal: which one ??
10/02/2016, 23:29 - Dhaani: The intern.
10/02/2016, 23:34 - Dhaani: Oi, I didn't make you uncomfortable with the compliments today, did I?
10/02/2016, 23:34 - Munjaal: nah , why would i feel uncomfortable ?
10/02/2016, 23:35 - Munjaal: I was rather glad you managed to add the plethora of adjectives
10/02/2016, 23:36 - Dhaani: Hahaha
10/02/2016, 23:47 - Dhaani: 😊
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: do listen to those songs once you're free okey ?
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Dhaani: I will.
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Dhaani: You're busy Kya?
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Dhaani: Studying?
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: nah not at all
10/02/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: 😅
10/02/2016, 23:55 - Munjaal: I should be studying but I'm not
10/02/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: Same as everyone else at mukesh Patel then.
10/02/2016, 23:55 - Munjaal: yupp :P 
Too late for the exam tomorrow. Too early for the M2
10/02/2016, 23:55 - Munjaal: Just the right to read a comic or two
10/02/2016, 23:58 - Dhaani: It isn't too late for the exam tomorrow, to be fair.
10/02/2016, 23:58 - Munjaal: 10am
10/02/2016, 23:58 - Dhaani: Still.
10/02/2016, 23:59 - Munjaal: tbh I don't even have a textbook 😅
10/02/2016, 23:59 - Munjaal: I'm relying on the people around me tomorrow
11/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: Ohh
11/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: Then it's cool
11/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: But stop doing that.
11/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: It takes an hour or two to study for a paper.
11/02/2016, 00:02 - Munjaal: I won't do it next exam onwards
11/02/2016, 00:02 - Dhaani: Pakka?
11/02/2016, 00:03 - Munjaal: Aye aye capn
11/02/2016, 00:04 - Dhaani: 😊
11/02/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: Great
11/02/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: Then I shall bother you no further about it.
11/02/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: What are you up to?
11/02/2016, 00:05 - Munjaal: Contemplating the complex nature of human consciences and consciousness
11/02/2016, 00:06 - Dhaani: Uh huh
11/02/2016, 00:07 - Munjaal: I do that shit at times as well. 😁
11/02/2016, 00:07 - Munjaal: I find many things weird
11/02/2016, 00:08 - Dhaani: I can't blame you.
11/02/2016, 00:09 - Munjaal: You do as well ?
11/02/2016, 00:10 - Dhaani: Sometimes.
11/02/2016, 00:10 - Dhaani: I'd think it shows in my writing...
11/02/2016, 00:11 - Munjaal: I guess.
11/02/2016, 00:12 - Dhaani: You don't think so.
11/02/2016, 00:12 - Dhaani: You know you can say that...
11/02/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: But I don't 'don't think so'
11/02/2016, 00:14 - Munjaal: I was just thinking.
11/02/2016, 00:14 - Munjaal: Since your writing takes to extremes at times.
11/02/2016, 00:14 - Munjaal: 😬
11/02/2016, 00:16 - Dhaani: Which ones have I made you read?
11/02/2016, 00:17 - Dhaani: I've seen people in extreme frames of mind.
11/02/2016, 00:18 - Munjaal: I haven't read but you ice told me of a poem depicting the perspective of a pedophile+murderer
11/02/2016, 00:19 - Munjaal: *once
11/02/2016, 00:19 - Dhaani: Ohh
11/02/2016, 00:19 - Dhaani: Yes, that was extreme
11/02/2016, 00:19 - Dhaani: Most isn't.
11/02/2016, 00:20 - Munjaal: 😪
11/02/2016, 00:21 - Munjaal: I just noticed. Your dog is so cute
11/02/2016, 00:21 - Munjaal: 🐶
11/02/2016, 00:22 - Dhaani: Thank you! 😊
11/02/2016, 00:23 - Munjaal: Gotta meet her once 😁
11/02/2016, 00:23 - Munjaal: Of thou permits
11/02/2016, 00:23 - Dhaani: Of course.
11/02/2016, 00:24 - Munjaal: 😊
11/02/2016, 00:25 - Munjaal: I forgot her name 😅
11/02/2016, 00:26 - Dhaani: Kelly
11/02/2016, 00:26 - Munjaal: Ah ,.. okay
11/02/2016, 00:27 - Munjaal: She don't bite right ?
11/02/2016, 00:28 - Dhaani: Not at all.
11/02/2016, 00:37 - Munjaal: Movie still on ?
11/02/2016, 00:37 - Dhaani: Yup.
11/02/2016, 00:37 - Dhaani: I keep pausing to reply to texts.
11/02/2016, 00:38 - Munjaal: 😯 finish it up.
11/02/2016, 00:38 - Munjaal: I won't interrupt
11/02/2016, 00:38 - Dhaani: Arre
11/02/2016, 00:38 - Dhaani: No
11/02/2016, 00:39 - Dhaani: It's OK.
11/02/2016, 00:40 - Dhaani: I'd rather keep the conversations.
11/02/2016, 00:41 - Munjaal: 😁
11/02/2016, 00:42 - Munjaal: You know. At least in my case. I can talk to you without much stress
11/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: Why is that surprising?
11/02/2016, 00:44 - Munjaal: I find most conversations exhaustive
11/02/2016, 00:44 - Munjaal: They tire me out
11/02/2016, 00:44 - Munjaal: Very rarely can I talk freely
11/02/2016, 00:44 - Dhaani: Ya?
11/02/2016, 00:45 - Dhaani: Well, then I am glad I don't stress you out.
11/02/2016, 00:46 - Munjaal: Even I can't understand why I get tired though. I had thought of asking you once
11/02/2016, 00:46 - Munjaal: But I thought it would sound lame so didn't
11/02/2016, 00:48 - Dhaani: I think it is because you're generally interacting with people you expect will judge you. Hence, you're more conscious of everything about you, which is exhausting.
11/02/2016, 00:48 - Munjaal: Never thought of it that way..
11/02/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: Make sense?
11/02/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: More sense than any I could think of
11/02/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: Honestly
11/02/2016, 00:52 - Dhaani: 😁
11/02/2016, 00:52 - Dhaani: Me smart.
11/02/2016, 00:53 - Munjaal: Aye aye.
11/02/2016, 00:53 - Munjaal: I used to think of it being a side effect of me being an introvert
11/02/2016, 00:53 - Munjaal: Or more like a trait of an introvert
11/02/2016, 00:54 - Dhaani: Sort of is. Introverts tend to be a lot more aware or conscious of themselves than extroverts.
11/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: Hmm
.. So it should be considered a good thing or bad ?
11/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: To be as much conscious as I am ?
11/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: Depends.
11/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: Being aware is good. Being overly conscious isn't.
11/02/2016, 00:57 - Munjaal: It'll take time adapting
11/02/2016, 00:57 - Dhaani: Of course. It'll take time drawing the line between them first.
11/02/2016, 00:58 - Munjaal: Trial and error might work maybe
11/02/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: It will.
11/02/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: And you have time.
11/02/2016, 00:59 - Munjaal: + guidance (you)
11/02/2016, 00:59 - Dhaani: Aah. Am I cast as the wise weird lady here?
11/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: No. But as the intelligent elegant senpai
11/02/2016, 01:01 - Dhaani: Elegant? Zyaada ho gaya...
11/02/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: Abhi synonym nahi mila
11/02/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: Fair enough.
11/02/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: I shall take it. 😁
11/02/2016, 02:53 - Dhaani: Still awake?
11/02/2016, 07:51 - Munjaal: I just dropped dead
11/02/2016, 09:00 - Dhaani: Huh
11/02/2016, 19:46 - Munjaal: i closed my eyes for a second and woke up in the morning
11/02/2016, 19:46 - Munjaal: 😅
11/02/2016, 19:51 - Dhaani: Hahaha
11/02/2016, 19:52 - Munjaal: last exam tomorrow ☺
11/02/2016, 19:52 - Dhaani: Mine is day after...
11/02/2016, 19:55 - Munjaal: hmm
11/02/2016, 19:55 - Munjaal: All the best.
11/02/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: Thanks
11/02/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: All the best to you too
11/02/2016, 21:58 - Munjaal: ooh !
11/02/2016, 21:58 - Munjaal: I forgot to ask , you wanna watch Deadpool ?
11/02/2016, 21:58 - Dhaani: I am going for it tomorrow morning. 😅
11/02/2016, 21:58 - Dhaani: With classmates.
11/02/2016, 21:58 - Dhaani: I misjudged how many people are going.
11/02/2016, 21:59 - Dhaani: Not sure I am looking forward to it.
11/02/2016, 21:59 - Dhaani: When are you going?
11/02/2016, 21:59 - Munjaal: I see !! :P Enjoy though
11/02/2016, 21:59 - Munjaal: Not decided
11/02/2016, 21:59 - Munjaal: 7 cuts have been made to the movie. I wonder if i should watch it
11/02/2016, 22:03 - Dhaani: I will watch it tomorrow and then watch the uncut one when someone downloads it and gives it to me. 😅
11/02/2016, 22:03 - Munjaal: lel

12/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: Nothing
12/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: Just texting.
12/02/2016, 00:43 - Dhaani: You?

12/02/2016, 00:47 - Munjaal: Its about time you restart you know
12/02/2016, 00:48 - Dhaani: Not really.
12/02/2016, 00:48 - Dhaani: Other things I need to catch up on first.
12/02/2016, 00:48 - Munjaal: Parallel ??
12/02/2016, 00:49 - Munjaal: I always try and do gaming parallel with other stuff
12/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: Haan but honestly no time.
12/02/2016, 00:52 - Munjaal: One busy lady you are
12/02/2016, 00:52 - Munjaal: 😝
12/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: Ofcourse
12/02/2016, 12:33 - Munjaal: COI Exam 😭

12/02/2016, 13:04 - Dhaani: Arre

12/02/2016, 13:06 - Munjaal: Are there any COI books in the library ?
12/02/2016, 13:06 - Dhaani: I have no idea.
12/02/2016, 13:07 - Dhaani: If you had told me, I'd have gotten my COI book.
12/02/2016, 13:07 - Munjaal: I don't actually need one. Just wanted to refer. In studying from the net

12/02/2016, 22:31 - Munjaal: not sure though 😅
12/02/2016, 22:31 - Dhaani: That's fine.
12/02/2016, 22:31 - Dhaani: She hardly gives marks in the first test.
12/02/2016, 22:33 - Munjaal: I see😒😞
12/02/2016, 22:33 - Munjaal: Well it wasn't really tough.
12/02/2016, 22:33 - Dhaani: I know.
12/02/2016, 22:34 - Dhaani: But she doesn't give marks.
12/02/2016, 22:34 - Dhaani: Specially in the first test.
12/02/2016, 22:34 - Dhaani: I didn't tell you in advance otherwise you would give up. 😅

12/02/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: I'm praying robocon won't hold me back tomorrow
12/02/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: 🙏🏻
12/02/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: They won't mostly.

12/02/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: Can't wait a little now?
12/02/2016, 23:50 - Munjaal: Not that
12/02/2016, 23:50 - Munjaal: okay , It'll be kinda tough to explain on call
12/02/2016, 23:51 - Dhaani: Ohh.
12/02/2016, 23:51 - Dhaani: When do you have your break tomorrow?
12/02/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: 1 to 2
12/02/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: 😐
12/02/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: I have my break from 11-12 if they don't reschedule anything.
12/02/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: Achcha at least tell me who the friend is
12/02/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: And what is this about?
12/02/2016, 23:57 - Munjaal: Call me up when you're free. I'll be able give you the jest of it now
12/02/2016, 23:57 - Dhaani: *gist
13/02/2016, 00:00 - Munjaal: Oh , jest = joke
13/02/2016, 00:00 - Munjaal: My bad
13/02/2016, 00:00 - Dhaani: Listen, can you tell me here?
13/02/2016, 00:00 - Dhaani: I could get into trouble for being on the phone now...
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: Alright.
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: I can understand
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: ?
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: He's overreacting to every thing cause of a girl
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: Who?
13/02/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: I've tried to tell him to calm down but he's messed up
13/02/2016, 00:02 - Munjaal: Even I haven't been in too deep like him.
13/02/2016, 00:02 - Munjaal: I needed your help on how to fix him
13/02/2016, 00:03 - Dhaani: Who is this?
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Dhaani: How long have they been dating?
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Munjaal: Dating ??
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Munjaal: Hahahahahaha
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Munjaal: Hahahahaha
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Munjaal: Oh god my stomach
13/02/2016, 00:04 - Dhaani: 😐
13/02/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: He is overreacting because of a crush?
13/02/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: And can you first tell me who we are talking about?
13/02/2016, 00:05 - Munjaal: Crush yes
13/02/2016, 00:05 - Munjaal: He's from DJ.
13/02/2016, 00:06 - Dhaani: Old friend?
13/02/2016, 00:06 - Dhaani: Overreacting in what way?
13/02/2016, 00:06 - Munjaal: [2/12, 11:14 PM] Megh Doshi: Okay, this I have to know, that aditya maniyar guy?
[2/12, 11:14 PM] Megh Doshi: Is there something?
[2/12, 11:14 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: Best friend
[2/12, 11:15 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: Is what she saus
[2/12, 11:15 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: But there's a very thin line between best friend and more than tgat so ......
[2/12, 11:15 PM] Megh Doshi: 😭🙈okay
[2/12, 11:16 PM] Megh Doshi: But what do you think?
[2/12, 11:17 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: I think there's something
[2/12, 11:17 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: But I'm not sure
[2/12, 11:17 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: We will talk about tat soon
[2/12, 11:17 PM] Megh Doshi: Okay😭
[2/12, 11:17 PM] Saloni Ajgaonkar: So when we will do I'll let you know
13/02/2016, 00:07 - Munjaal: He is megh
13/02/2016, 00:07 - Munjaal: Saloni is the friend of the girl he likes
13/02/2016, 00:07 - Dhaani: Of course.
13/02/2016, 00:07 - Munjaal: And they're talking about a third guy
13/02/2016, 00:08 - Munjaal: I guess you can understand by the chat itself
13/02/2016, 00:08 - Dhaani: Yup.
13/02/2016, 00:12 - Munjaal: I'm sorry for bothering you with this. Didn't want to actually
13/02/2016, 00:12 - Dhaani: Arre relax yaa
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Dhaani: How long have you guys been friends?
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Dhaani: And how much does he trust your judgment?
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Dhaani: And is he very close to Saloni?
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: Quite some time. I guess 2 years.
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: He's close to me
13/02/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: Saloni .. Not very much
13/02/2016, 00:14 - Dhaani: Because Saloni seems to be encouraging this behavior for her amusement. 😐
13/02/2016, 00:14 - Munjaal: Oh 😦 that's...
13/02/2016, 00:14 - Dhaani: What?
13/02/2016, 00:14 - Dhaani: You didn't notice?
13/02/2016, 00:14 - Munjaal: Nah I couldn't.
13/02/2016, 00:15 - Munjaal: When it comes to reading a girl I'm blank
13/02/2016, 00:15 - Dhaani: Make sense?
13/02/2016, 00:15 - Dhaani: Does it make sense that she might be doing that?
13/02/2016, 00:16 - Dhaani: Since I just have that one snippet of conversation that I am judging on the basis of...
13/02/2016, 00:16 - Munjaal: She might. I have no clue about her personality
13/02/2016, 00:16 - Munjaal: But there's another thing that Megh had told me about the other guy quite some time back
13/02/2016, 00:17 - Munjaal: That he was suspicious there was something wrong
13/02/2016, 00:18 - Dhaani: No. He has no right to interfere as far as the girl and the other guy are concerned. It is none of his business.
13/02/2016, 00:18 - Munjaal: I guess I miscommunicated
13/02/2016, 00:19 - Dhaani: Go on.
13/02/2016, 00:19 - Munjaal: He wanted to know if she likes him or not. Cause if she did , he'll back out. And if she didn't , well.. He has a chance
13/02/2016, 00:19 - Munjaal: I mean , if she likes the other guy or not
13/02/2016, 00:21 - Dhaani: That's the thing. Your friend has no right to knowing that either.
13/02/2016, 00:21 - Munjaal: Hmm
13/02/2016, 00:22 - Munjaal: Normally I'd agree
13/02/2016, 00:22 - Dhaani: Your friend can ask about whether she is interested in him but not about the other guy.
13/02/2016, 00:22 - Munjaal: But this case is a little peculiar
13/02/2016, 00:23 - Dhaani: Why so?
13/02/2016, 00:23 - Munjaal: There a lot to tell you ... I dunno where to start.
13/02/2016, 00:24 - Munjaal: Let's just keep it to this much for now.
13/02/2016, 00:24 - Dhaani: Alright.
13/02/2016, 00:24 - Dhaani: Tell me the rest when I see you.
13/02/2016, 00:24 - Munjaal: Sure
13/02/2016, 00:24 - Dhaani: Then I'll give proper advice.
13/02/2016, 00:25 - Munjaal: Arigatou gozaimas!
13/02/2016, 00:25 - Dhaani: ?
13/02/2016, 00:25 - Munjaal: Thanks a lot !
13/02/2016, 00:29 - Dhaani: 😊
13/02/2016, 00:29 - Munjaal: Well. Enough of my problems. How was your day ?
13/02/2016, 00:30 - Dhaani: My day was alright.
13/02/2016, 00:30 - Dhaani: Had a killer headache throughout.
13/02/2016, 00:30 - Dhaani: I haven't studied for tomorrow's test, which is odd for me.
13/02/2016, 00:30 - Munjaal: 😧
13/02/2016, 00:30 - Munjaal: Low sugar by any chance ?
13/02/2016, 00:31 - Dhaani: Nahi. That I would realize.
13/02/2016, 00:32 - Munjaal: Stress maybe ? Did you take meds though ?
13/02/2016, 00:32 - Dhaani: I've had a headache for a couple of days, actually.
13/02/2016, 00:35 - Munjaal: Go visit a doc
13/02/2016, 00:35 - Dhaani: Nahi.
13/02/2016, 00:35 - Munjaal: A couple of days is bad
13/02/2016, 00:35 - Dhaani: It'll go.
13/02/2016, 00:36 - Munjaal: Even so, being on a safer side is always preferred right
13/02/2016, 00:46 - Dhaani: It is.
13/02/2016, 00:46 - Dhaani: But never mind yaa
13/02/2016, 00:48 - Munjaal: 😒
13/02/2016, 00:49 - Munjaal: Reckless
13/02/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: Not reckless.
13/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: It the first few days of this week, my head was hurting because of a cold yaa.
13/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: Other days, it was stress.
13/02/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: Why so much stress ?? 😞
13/02/2016, 00:51 - Dhaani: Long story yaa. Never mind that.
13/02/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: Is it something personal.?
13/02/2016, 00:54 - Dhaani: Yes.
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: I see. Fix it up and be back to normal 😉
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: I am.
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: I am normal now.
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: Awesome..
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: 😁
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: You sure right ?
13/02/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: Ya baba
13/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: Kabhi kabhi galti se stress le leti hoon
13/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: But it doesn't last long. 😜
13/02/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: 😪👍🏻  ok
13/02/2016, 00:57 - Dhaani: Honestly, do I seem like I get stressed easily?
13/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: If one were to judge only by incomplete knowledge they'd disagree. But knowing how much you care about those close to you, it might be possible.
13/02/2016, 01:00 - Munjaal: Well , at least that's what I think
13/02/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: I do care about people. But if I were to get stressed,  I won't be able to be there for them, which isn't an option in my mind.
13/02/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: Hmm.. A situation where you are rendered helpless perhaps ?
13/02/2016, 01:04 - Dhaani: Not exactly.
13/02/2016, 01:07 - Munjaal: Well I must accept that something with the caliber to shake you up would have to be colossal. Other than that, dunno
13/02/2016, 01:10 - Dhaani: I hope you're right.
13/02/2016, 01:12 - Munjaal: Don't like seeing someone as cheerful as you feel down.

I can help as well 😉
Do share if you feel like alright ?
13/02/2016, 01:12 - Dhaani: Baba, not down. Just thoda tired.
13/02/2016, 01:12 - Munjaal: Aye aye, I got that. But I'm just saying
13/02/2016, 01:13 - Dhaani: I am missing Kala ghoda this time.
13/02/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: Busy schedule ?
13/02/2016, 01:14 - Dhaani: Sort of.
13/02/2016, 01:14 - Dhaani: 😢
13/02/2016, 01:14 - Munjaal: You're one busy girl. Honestly 😜
13/02/2016, 01:15 - Munjaal: Not that I'm not, but still....
13/02/2016, 01:15 - Dhaani: Nahi yaa
13/02/2016, 01:16 - Munjaal: Rehene do aap
13/02/2016, 01:16 - Dhaani: Arre seriously.
13/02/2016, 01:16 - Dhaani: I have strange commitments.
13/02/2016, 01:16 - Munjaal: "Strange" ? 😂
13/02/2016, 01:17 - Munjaal: That sounds funny at best
13/02/2016, 01:18 - Dhaani: Meh.
13/02/2016, 01:18 - Dhaani: You don't want to know. 😅
13/02/2016, 01:19 - Munjaal: That makes me wanna know more.. 😝 shouldn't have said that
13/02/2016, 01:19 - Dhaani: Maybe I said that on purpose.
13/02/2016, 01:19 - Dhaani: 😁
13/02/2016, 01:19 - Dhaani: Yaar, you know the kind of things I spend my time doing na.
13/02/2016, 01:20 - Munjaal: Yaa. 😂
13/02/2016, 01:21 - Munjaal: That's precisely why I said it sounded funny at best .. 😛
13/02/2016, 01:22 - Dhaani: Yup
13/02/2016, 01:24 - Munjaal: Best of luck with it.. 😋
13/02/2016, 01:24 - Munjaal: 😁
13/02/2016, 01:28 - Dhaani: Achcha tell me something
13/02/2016, 01:28 - Munjaal: Something
13/02/2016, 01:29 - Dhaani: 😒
13/02/2016, 01:29 - Munjaal: You asked for it😆
13/02/2016, 01:29 - Dhaani: Sleep.
13/02/2016, 01:30 - Munjaal: Go on.
13/02/2016, 01:30 - Munjaal: What is it ?
13/02/2016, 01:31 - Dhaani: What was the first impression you had of me? After the first time we spoke, how would you have described me?
13/02/2016, 01:31 - Munjaal: Hmm
13/02/2016, 01:36 - Munjaal: You seemed like a person naturally talented in the art of speech craft. Holding a conversation somehow seemed almost effortless(I doubt it was the same on your side). As a person I look up to you. But at the same time there was something else as well that I kinda thought.
13/02/2016, 01:38 - Munjaal: Something that slightly bothered me. I've known but a few people who have talents similar to yours and most of em have gone through or are going througb something terrible.
13/02/2016, 01:39 - Munjaal: Wondered but hoped you weren't the same
13/02/2016, 01:39 - Dhaani: Define terriblev
13/02/2016, 01:39 - Dhaani: *terrible
13/02/2016, 01:40 - Dhaani: Nahi, I've had an easy life for the most part.
13/02/2016, 01:40 - Munjaal: A past friend of mine. Excellent at social skills but his family life is messed. Stress between mom and dad, etc
13/02/2016, 01:41 - Munjaal: I've got quite a few examples like that.
13/02/2016, 01:41 - Dhaani: I've had my share if bad but it was a while back and thankfully, it wasn't from family.
13/02/2016, 01:42 - Dhaani: Don't worry.
13/02/2016, 01:42 - Munjaal: 😌 phew
13/02/2016, 01:42 - Munjaal: I guess everyone has to go through their share of pain. Sometime in their life
13/02/2016, 01:43 - Dhaani: Exactly.
13/02/2016, 01:43 - Dhaani: It's what makes us grow.
13/02/2016, 01:44 - Munjaal: Man I wish growing was simple. But if it were there'd be no challenge.
13/02/2016, 01:44 - Munjaal: Gotta hang on and make the best of what we get 😊😉
13/02/2016, 01:46 - Dhaani: Growing isn't very difficult.
13/02/2016, 01:48 - Munjaal: It feels difficult. But when you're out, you realise some things didn't even deserve the amount of time you gave.
13/02/2016, 01:49 - Munjaal: That's good it has been for me
13/02/2016, 01:49 - Munjaal: *that's how
13/02/2016, 02:03 - Munjaal: I guess that was enough philosophical talk for a day's worth 😅
I'll try not to go down this conversational trail next time.

Goodnight 🙂😉
13/02/2016, 08:04 - Dhaani: Good morning.
13/02/2016, 10:27 - Munjaal: Morning
13/02/2016, 17:34 - Dhaani: Sorry, I was out when you called.
13/02/2016, 19:17 - Munjaal: Its ok
13/02/2016, 20:08 - Munjaal: I'll have to work tomorrow 😣
13/02/2016, 20:09 - Munjaal: This place was completely occupied today
13/02/2016, 20:25 - Dhaani: 😐
13/02/2016, 20:25 - Dhaani: Achcha listen, are you guys planning a cake for tomorrow m

17/02/2016, 00:15 - Munjaal: ok
17/02/2016, 00:16 - Dhaani: I wrote a poem yesterday.
17/02/2016, 00:16 - Dhaani: Want to read?
17/02/2016, 00:16 - Munjaal: aye
17/02/2016, 00:16 - Dhaani: Abhi bheju?
17/02/2016, 00:22 - Dhaani: 😓
17/02/2016, 00:37 - Munjaal: haan
17/02/2016, 00:38 - Dhaani: Turn back time 
I have come too far 
I was meant to have more time on my hands. 
Living the dream 
With every lush stroke 
How did I paint this nightmare as it now stands?  
So caught up in the chase 
Adding shine to the glaze 
Gathering extravagance 
My state grows dire. 
I am left clutching 
Mere wisps of desire. 

Try to recall 
Every moment gone waste 
All I remember 
Is the rush, the haste 
The pace that became my high. 
Chasing each prize, 
My eyes on the goal, 
They sliced the pie, 
I swallowed it whole, 
Turning my back on every ally. 
Look at me now 
Imagine my ire 
When I am left clutching 
Mere wisps of desire. 

Need to tie it down now 
So begins the end 
Time to face myself, 
All notions to suspend. 
Run too far, too long 
Now come to a stop 
At the very thought 
Feel my stomach flop. 
Holding onto faith 
As I lose my spirit, 
Resist the universe itself 
Even when my pyre has been lit. 
Auctioned my soul 
To the highest buyer 
Now I am left clutching 
Mere wisps of desire.
17/02/2016, 00:43 - Munjaal: ❤
17/02/2016, 00:47 - Dhaani: Really?

17/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: Nahi
17/02/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: I really don't want to.

17/02/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: I see
17/02/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: Is Hindi tougher ?
17/02/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: In terms of literature
17/02/2016, 01:03 - Dhaani: No.
17/02/2016, 01:04 - Dhaani: But Mumbai doesn't expose me to regular practice with good Hindi.
17/02/2016, 01:04 - Dhaani: Though I speak in Hindi at home, I don't have the kind of vocabulary in Hindi that would allow me to rhyme.
17/02/2016, 07:00 - Munjaal: Sorry I slept
17/02/2016, 07:00 - Munjaal: Was exhausted

21/02/2016, 00:47 - Munjaal: Aye.
21/02/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: And do you want a box of that thingy for your throat?
21/02/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: Since it doesn't qualify in your no medicine policy

06/03/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: Ohkay. That doesn't sound pleasant.
06/03/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: I couldn't find staying there without an aim comfortable
06/03/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: As long as there was the competition , I could work
06/03/2016, 01:04 - Dhaani: Arre baba, you deserve a day of a break, of relaxing and of fun na.

06/03/2016, 01:13 - Dhaani: But since it broke skin, I need injections.
06/03/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: Oh.

06/03/2016, 01:15 - Dhaani: Kelly doesn't know.
06/03/2016, 01:15 - Dhaani: I don't want her to feel any pressure or get silly notions of revenge into her stubborn head.
06/03/2016, 01:16 - Dhaani: 😋
06/03/2016, 01:16 - Munjaal: 😂

06/03/2016, 01:33 - Dhaani: How am I a hypocrite?
06/03/2016, 01:34 - Munjaal: You keep telling others to take care of themselves ...
06/03/2016, 01:34 - Munjaal: And you don't do it yourself
06/03/2016, 01:35 - Dhaani: I do take care!
06/03/2016, 01:35 - Munjaal: 😑
06/03/2016, 01:35 - Dhaani: Shit happens sometimes. But it wasn't because I wasn't taking care.
06/03/2016, 01:36 - Munjaal: Sometimes looks like a wrong term you know 😅
06/03/2016, 01:36 - Dhaani: I know. What to do?

11/03/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: Only that you'll think of it and proceed
11/03/2016, 23:28 - Munjaal: As it's not the same from your side
11/03/2016, 23:29 - Dhaani: Ohh...
11/03/2016, 23:29 - Dhaani: I might be beginning to return the feelings but I don't want to act on them just yet.

11/03/2016, 23:38 - Munjaal: Hmm
11/03/2016, 23:38 - Dhaani: Honestly, haven't dated in over 2 and a half years.
11/03/2016, 23:38 - Dhaani: And was in some really messed up relationships then.
11/03/2016, 23:39 - Dhaani: The idea is thoda intimidating.
11/03/2016, 23:39 - Munjaal: Well. You know it's hard to believe. Just saying
11/03/2016, 23:40 - Dhaani: What's hard to believe?
11/03/2016, 23:43 - Munjaal: That even you can have bad relationships. But who am I to conclude any thing 😁?
11/03/2016, 23:43 - Dhaani: Munjaal, let this topic go.
11/03/2016, 23:43 - Dhaani: You don't want details, trust me.
11/03/2016, 23:44 - Munjaal: You've mentioned them before.
11/03/2016, 23:44 - Dhaani: What did I tell you?
11/03/2016, 23:44 - Munjaal: I don't quite remember it well.
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Munjaal: Nvm
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Dhaani: Ok.
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Munjaal: Not a good conversation anyway
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Dhaani: Exactly
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Munjaal: I feel handicapped on whatsapp.
11/03/2016, 23:45 - Munjaal: Can talk much more efficiently in real life
11/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: Achcha tell me something... How badly do I seem to be interested in this guy?
11/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: Same here yaa! Real life conversations are so much more comfortable!
11/03/2016, 23:46 - Munjaal: Exactly!
11/03/2016, 23:47 - Munjaal: I don't have a good enough base to make a judgement on that
11/03/2016, 23:47 - Dhaani: Alright.
11/03/2016, 23:47 - Munjaal: But that question itself can be a good enough hint I guess
11/03/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: 🙈
11/03/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: This is not good!
11/03/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: Let's just change the topic.

11/03/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: Even for Dhenuka, I should've given it to her directly
11/03/2016, 23:55 - Munjaal: They keep requesting me to make it for their friends 😞
11/03/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: Hahaha
11/03/2016, 23:55 - Dhaani: Now suffer.

11/03/2016, 23:57 - Munjaal: You didn't have to mention that
11/03/2016, 23:57 - Munjaal: Did we talk about anything ? I don't remember ...

12/03/2016, 23:39 - Dhaani: That happened a long time back.
12/03/2016, 23:39 - Munjaal: I've got all the time
12/03/2016, 23:39 - Dhaani: June 29, 2003, to be precise.
12/03/2016, 23:41 - Munjaal: Wut happened though ?
12/03/2016, 23:41 - Munjaal: Something as good/bad such that you still remember the date
12/03/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: Nahi yaa
12/03/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: I have a bit of a random memory.
12/03/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: It was in Mathura.
12/03/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: At my mausi's place.
12/03/2016, 23:43 - Dhaani: Was sitting on an old deewan when I noticed the time and realized that I am going to miss Pokemon so I got up to run to the other room.
12/03/2016, 23:43 - Dhaani: I didn't realize that the laminate on the side of the deewan was peeling off
12/03/2016, 23:44 - Dhaani: So my heel slid under that and the laminate sliced into my ankle from the back as I lifted the leg to run.
12/03/2016, 23:44 - Dhaani: Needless to say, I fell.
12/03/2016, 23:44 - Dhaani: And was hurt badly enough to miss Pokemon anyway.
12/03/2016, 23:44 - Dhaani: 😅
12/03/2016, 23:45 - Munjaal: That sounds very painful 😳
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: It was. And I was just 8 at the time.
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: Wow. I was just 8 at the time.
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: You were 5!
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Munjaal: 😓
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Dhaani: Hahaha
12/03/2016, 23:46 - Munjaal: 😛
12/03/2016, 23:47 - Dhaani: So did I tell you about my hand that is having a rough march?
12/03/2016, 23:47 - Munjaal: The dogbite was followed by something else ?
12/03/2016, 23:47 - Dhaani: The hand that got burnt in the oven, then got burnt by hot chai and then got bitten by a dog?
12/03/2016, 23:47 - Dhaani: Yes, it got cut while I was opening a can of olives today.
12/03/2016, 23:48 - Dhaani: And I hate rabies injections. They have side effects. 😖
12/03/2016, 23:48 - Dhaani: Sorry.
12/03/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: I felt like whining.
12/03/2016, 23:49 - Dhaani: 😅
12/03/2016, 23:49 - Munjaal: 😳😳😳😳😳😳
12/03/2016, 23:49 - Munjaal: Wtf
12/03/2016, 23:50 - Dhaani: What?
12/03/2016, 23:50 - Munjaal: Do you even take care of yourself
12/03/2016, 23:52 - Dhaani: Yes
12/03/2016, 23:52 - Dhaani: Hand got burnt in the oven when I was making brownies.
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Munjaal: 😑
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: Mum accidentally stepped in my way just as I was getting a tray out so I moved my hand so it touched the rod.
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: It was either that or burning mum with the hot tray.😐
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: The second time, someone else spilled chai on my hand.
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: Not my fault.
12/03/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: Why the face?
12/03/2016, 23:55 - Munjaal: I'll have to break into your house and steal everything sharp, pointy , potentially lethal
12/03/2016, 23:56 - Dhaani: Hahaha
12/03/2016, 23:56 - Dhaani: And again, the dog biting me was not my fault.
12/03/2016, 23:56 - Dhaani: It was very uncharacteristic of the dog.
12/03/2016, 23:56 - Dhaani: The cut from the can was a little my fault. 😅
12/03/2016, 23:57 - Dhaani: And I can't decide whether or not I experience side effects from the injections na.
12/03/2016, 23:58 - Munjaal: 😤
12/03/2016, 23:58 - Munjaal: still ...
12/03/2016, 23:58 - Dhaani: What?
12/03/2016, 23:58 - Dhaani: I am taking care.
12/03/2016, 23:59 - Dhaani: I've been resting after every injection after I understood the side effects after the first injection.
12/03/2016, 23:59 - Munjaal: finally something good :P
13/03/2016, 00:00 - Dhaani: Exactly. I take care.
13/03/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: hmm
13/03/2016, 00:01 - Munjaal: how many more to go ?
13/03/2016, 00:01 - Dhaani: Two more.

13/03/2016, 00:05 - Munjaal: 2 more times the side effects
13/03/2016, 00:05 - Dhaani: Yup.

15/03/2016, 14:05 - Dhaani: I have to give you the bearing.
15/03/2016, 14:05 - Dhaani: For you to know what has to fit where you remove the threading.

16/03/2016, 12:50 - Dhaani: And can you give me an idea as to when you'll be doing this?

16/03/2016, 20:38 - Munjaal: Okay
16/03/2016, 20:49 - Dhaani: 😊
17/03/2016, 17:25 - Munjaal: 🤔
17/03/2016, 17:37 - Dhaani: Sorry yaa
17/03/2016, 17:38 - Dhaani: Was next to mum.

18/03/2016, 16:52 - Munjaal: Nope. At friend's place
18/03/2016, 16:52 - Dhaani: You said yesterday that you'll be going to maker's today and that you needed one of us to come along...
18/03/2016, 16:53 - Munjaal: I'm got my drill back

18/03/2016, 16:56 - Munjaal: Aye
18/03/2016, 16:56 - Dhaani: 😁
18/03/2016, 16:56 - Dhaani: You remember what has to be done?
18/03/2016, 16:57 - Munjaal: I've to take dimensions, 1 from the file and 1 of the bearing you gave and remove the threading right ?
18/03/2016, 16:57 - Munjaal: So they can be attached
18/03/2016, 16:59 - Dhaani: What?
18/03/2016, 17:00 - Munjaal: The rods
18/03/2016, 17:00 - Munjaal: Bearing >> rod >> motor coupling
18/03/2016, 17:00 - Munjaal: Right ?
18/03/2016, 17:01 - Dhaani: Wait, I'll call.
18/03/2016, 17:01 - Munjaal: No wait I'll call
19/03/2016, 11:35 - Munjaal: Message me up when free
19/03/2016, 11:45 - Munjaal: Can you send me the dimensions here pls 😅😅
19/03/2016, 11:46 - Dhaani: The rod which had the coupler, shorten from other end by 4cm. Then remove threading for 1cm so the bearing I gave you can fit properly.
19/03/2016, 11:47 - Dhaani: The rod with a bearing at one end, shorten from other end by 4cm. Then remove threading for 1.5 cm.
19/03/2016, 12:03 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
19/03/2016, 15:06 - Munjaal: Come to the basement if you're in college

27/04/2016, 20:46 - Dhaani: Oye
27/04/2016, 20:46 - Dhaani: What?
27/04/2016, 21:20 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/04/2016, 21:20 - Munjaal: Forget what she asked earlier , she's requesting me to make that again
27/04/2016, 21:21 - Munjaal: I don't feel like working hard for a person I don't even know
27/04/2016, 22:03 - Dhaani: You don't have to.
27/04/2016, 22:04 - Dhaani: You can simply shrug it off with "sorry, I am a little busy with my own things these days. Don't think I'll find the time soon. "
27/04/2016, 22:35 - Dhaani: I look like I am working?
27/04/2016, 22:36 - Munjaal: Cause you were in formals
27/04/2016, 22:36 - Munjaal: And she saw you for the first time
27/04/2016, 22:36 - Dhaani: Still
27/04/2016, 22:36 - Dhaani: 😐
27/04/2016, 22:37 - Dhaani: Give me her details. ⚔🛠⚒
27/04/2016, 22:37 - Munjaal: 😂😂😂😂
27/04/2016, 22:37 - Dhaani: Now!
27/04/2016, 22:37 - Munjaal: lel
27/04/2016, 22:37 - Munjaal: She's a noob.
27/04/2016, 22:38 - Dhaani: I don't like her. We'll find you better people to interact with.
27/04/2016, 22:38 - Dhaani: And why the face with the question? 😠
27/04/2016, 22:39 - Munjaal: Accha , I wanted to ask you, can I tell her something on the lines of "I worked hard for the gift cause you were a friend, it'd be unfair for your friend to receive something from you on which you haven't worked"
27/04/2016, 22:40 - Munjaal: Cause earlier when I had asked her what her plan was , she told me she had a date
27/04/2016, 22:40 - Munjaal: And we bumped at Prithvi
27/04/2016, 22:41 - Dhaani: She was there on a date?
27/04/2016, 22:41 - Dhaani: And no. You can not say that.
27/04/2016, 22:41 - Dhaani: It is too angsty. Like you're trying to make her feel guilty.
27/04/2016, 22:42 - Munjaal: Ooh
27/04/2016, 22:42 - Munjaal: Yeah she was
27/04/2016, 22:44 - Dhaani: Meh.
27/04/2016, 22:45 - Dhaani: Next time someone asks you whether you're out on a date, simply go like "I am not sure about that"
27/04/2016, 22:45 - Dhaani: If you're feeling a little more like messing around, add something along the lines of it's fun so you don't care about what to call it.
27/04/2016, 22:46 - Munjaal: Hmmm
27/04/2016, 22:46 - Munjaal: I'll keep that in mind
27/04/2016, 22:46 - Dhaani: She asked with that face to ascertain whether she can still get you to do her bidding, basically. So throw them off.
27/04/2016, 22:46 - Munjaal: I see. That evil intent lol
27/04/2016, 22:47 - Dhaani: What?
27/04/2016, 22:47 - Munjaal: She
27/04/2016, 22:47 - Dhaani: Tell me if I am misjudging.
27/04/2016, 22:47 - Munjaal: No

30/04/2016, 01:19 - Dhaani: Fair enough.

30/04/2016, 01:22 - Dhaani: Will all the robocon juniors even be interested?
30/04/2016, 01:23 - Munjaal: Only the previous team will cash in
30/04/2016, 01:23 - Munjaal: And maybe we'll be allowed to withdraw a tiny bit from the committee's treasury
30/04/2016, 01:24 - Dhaani: I don't that

01/05/2016, 01:08 - Dhaani: That didn't work.
01/05/2016, 01:08 - Dhaani: 😁

01/05/2016, 01:11 - Dhaani: Or you need to work on your typing skills.

01/05/2016, 01:11 - Munjaal: Phone can't keep up when I swipe fast
01/05/2016, 01:12 - Dhaani: Aah
01/05/2016, 01:12 - Dhaani: So simply type type fast na instead of swiping...
01/05/2016, 01:12 - Dhaani: I realized typing is faster.
01/05/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: Ohkay
01/05/2016, 01:13 - Dhaani: Because you have to correct too many words in swiping.
01/05/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: Gotta try that as well
01/05/2016, 01:13 - Dhaani: I swipe when I am lazy.

01/05/2016, 01:24 - Munjaal: Some girl I know. I don't even like her
01/05/2016, 01:24 - Munjaal: I wonder why such a weird dream
01/05/2016, 01:24 - Dhaani: Happens yaa
01/05/2016, 01:24 - Dhaani: It doesn't mean anything.
01/05/2016, 01:25 - Munjaal: I might be going crazy, that's all it can mean 😂
01/05/2016, 01:26 - Dhaani: Hahaha
01/05/2016, 01:26 - Dhaani: Not really.
01/05/2016, 01:26 - Munjaal: Actually ya. Not really. I already am 😜
01/05/2016, 01:26 - Dhaani: Hahahaha
01/05/2016, 01:27 - Dhaani: Seriously, it happens

01/05/2016, 01:29 - Dhaani: Last week, in a dream, I kissed someone I know. Someone I would never look at that way.
01/05/2016, 01:29 - Dhaani: It was thoda disturbing.
01/05/2016, 01:30 - Munjaal: Ooh
01/05/2016, 01:30 - Munjaal: I wonder why they happen
01/05/2016, 01:30 - Munjaal: These dreams
01/05/2016, 01:30 - Dhaani: I got used to ignoring them though after an extended phase of nightmares.
01/05/2016, 01:30 - Dhaani: Quite some time back.
01/05/2016, 01:31 - Munjaal: You've had frequent nightmares ?
01/05/2016, 01:31 - Munjaal: 😯
01/05/2016, 01:31 - Dhaani: I have had phases of a couple months at a time where I'd have multiple nightmares every night.
01/05/2016, 01:31 - Dhaani: And those nightmares were really bad.
01/05/2016, 01:32 - Munjaal: 😦
01/05/2016, 01:32 - Munjaal: Was it cause if some mental stress ?
01/05/2016, 01:32 - Dhaani: Once of twice, a single nightmare could leave me disturbed for days.
01/05/2016, 01:33 - Dhaani: I don't know yaa. Things are generally rather eventful.
01/05/2016, 01:33 - Munjaal: Disturbed for days ?? Hey that ain't normal
01/05/2016, 01:33 - Munjaal: What were they about , temme
01/05/2016, 01:35 - Dhaani: Well, generally people I care about or even just know getting tortured or dying in either very gruesome or very believable ways
01/05/2016, 11:00 - Munjaal: 😨
01/05/2016, 11:07 - Munjaal: Lots of God of War maybe 😜
01/05/2016, 11:58 - Dhaani: Nahi.
01/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: There have been some worse nightmares too.
01/05/2016, 12:13 - Munjaal: Well, good thing they stopped now
01/05/2016, 12:17 - Dhaani: 😅

01/05/2016, 12:18 - Dhaani: Never mind.
01/05/2016, 12:19 - Dhaani: It was all misunderstandings and such. And me trying to explain how I feel.
01/05/2016, 12:19 - Munjaal: Oh... Okay ... Brother ?
01/05/2016, 12:19 - Dhaani: I was properly crying for over an hour in the dream. Don't know how long that is in real time.
01/05/2016, 12:19 - Dhaani: Nahi. Other stuff.
01/05/2016, 12:20 - Munjaal: Dream and real time is 1:1

03/05/2016, 22:56 - Munjaal: Hmm
03/05/2016, 22:56 - Munjaal: Accha I was thinking about a topic. Wanted your view of it
03/05/2016, 22:57 - Dhaani: Boli
03/05/2016, 22:57 - Dhaani: *bolo
03/05/2016, 22:58 - Munjaal: Euthanasia
03/05/2016, 23:02 - Dhaani: What about it?
03/05/2016, 23:03 - Munjaal: You think it should be legal ?
03/05/2016, 23:03 - Dhaani: I think it would be hard to regulate.
03/05/2016, 23:03 - Munjaal: As in ?
03/05/2016, 23:05 - Dhaani: In an ideal world, I think it should be legal.
03/05/2016, 23:05 - Munjaal: Hmm
03/05/2016, 23:05 - Dhaani: But messed up families would use it to kill off relatives for inheritance.
03/05/2016, 23:06 - Munjaal: Yeah. There's THAT as well
03/05/2016, 23:06 - Munjaal: Maybe only self permitted ?
03/05/2016, 23:11 - Dhaani: Faking a signature?
03/05/2016, 23:11 - Dhaani: And the ones who really need it are often in no state to give consent.
03/05/2016, 23:12 - Munjaal: True that
03/05/2016, 23:12 - Munjaal: Well thanks
03/05/2016, 23:12 - Dhaani: For what?
03/05/2016, 23:13 - Munjaal: This topic suddenly came to my mind. 😅
03/05/2016, 23:13 - Munjaal: For sharing your point of view
03/05/2016, 23:14 - Dhaani: What's yours?
03/05/2016, 23:15 - Munjaal: I'm damn confused.
03/05/2016, 23:15 - Munjaal: I believe that one needs to undergo his share of suffering
03/05/2016, 23:15 - Munjaal: But at the same time , looking at certain people breaks me
03/05/2016, 23:19 - Dhaani: I know.
03/05/2016, 23:20 - Munjaal: Off with this morbid topic anyway
03/05/2016, 23:20 - Dhaani: I agree you know.
03/05/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: Which is why I think ideally it should be legal.
03/05/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: Aye
03/05/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: It isn't an ideal world.
03/05/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: To be honest I don't want it to be
03/05/2016, 23:22 - Munjaal: It's fine with a little human error
03/05/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: 😊
03/05/2016, 23:23 - Munjaal: 😅

13/05/2016, 23:20 - Munjaal: Yeah pretty much
13/05/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: Then let's not worry.
13/05/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: How are you?
13/05/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: Well
13/05/2016, 23:21 - Dhaani: You must be exhausted...
13/05/2016, 23:21 - Munjaal: Doctors given up hope...
13/05/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: I am sorry to hear that.
13/05/2016, 23:22 - Munjaal: Let's see.
13/05/2016, 23:22 - Munjaal: Whatever happens is not in our hands
13/05/2016, 23:22 - Dhaani: That is true...
13/05/2016, 23:23 - Munjaal: There's lots to tell. But that can wait
13/05/2016, 23:23 - Dhaani: Kya hua?

13/05/2016, 23:25 - Dhaani: I know. Still.
13/05/2016, 23:25 - Dhaani: You're also a stubborn absent minded kid who sometimes forgets himself.
13/05/2016, 23:26 - Munjaal: 😅
13/05/2016, 23:26 - Dhaani: So, just reminding you to take care.
13/05/2016, 23:26 - Dhaani: Even in simple things like meals and sleep.
13/05/2016, 23:27 - Munjaal: Aye aye

14/05/2016, 11:48 - Munjaal: You're amazing at writing anyway
14/05/2016, 11:49 - Dhaani: Nahi. Not this shit.
14/05/2016, 11:49 - Dhaani: A 250 word sop for why I want to join the course.
14/05/2016, 11:49 - Munjaal: Tell them why you're fit for it.
14/05/2016, 11:50 - Munjaal: That's the general procedure for most colleges
14/05/2016, 11:50 - Dhaani: And my professional experience with decision making, R&D, innovation, consultancy work.
14/05/2016, 11:50 - Dhaani: That's supposed to be a different document.
14/05/2016, 11:50 - Munjaal: Hmm

15/05/2016, 02:33 - Munjaal: You can tell me if you're comfortable
15/05/2016, 02:33 - Munjaal: I'm up anyway 😋😉
15/05/2016, 02:38 - Dhaani: Why are you up?
15/05/2016, 02:39 - Munjaal: was fixing the pc
15/05/2016, 02:39 - Munjaal: Got spoilt again
15/05/2016, 02:39 - Dhaani: What happened?
15/05/2016, 02:40 - Munjaal: Boot sector corruption , BSODs , Installation Failures , all that stuff. But we're shifting from topic here
15/05/2016, 02:42 - Munjaal: No cheating 😛
15/05/2016, 02:42 - Dhaani: Hahaha
15/05/2016, 02:42 - Dhaani: Nothing to worry about.
15/05/2016, 02:43 - Munjaal: I guess I'll just have to go with that for now...
15/05/2016, 02:48 - Dhaani: Yup.
15/05/2016, 02:48 - Dhaani: Have I told you you're too sweet?
15/05/2016, 02:48 - Munjaal: 😛
15/05/2016, 02:48 - Munjaal: To a select few people I care about
15/05/2016, 02:48 - Dhaani: 😅
15/05/2016, 02:49 - Munjaal: To others I range from arrogant to ignorant to dumb as well
15/05/2016, 02:56 - Dhaani: Really?
15/05/2016, 02:56 - Dhaani: Arrogant?
15/05/2016, 02:56 - Munjaal: Yeah. Well .. I try to be
15/05/2016, 02:56 - Munjaal: Usually fail though
15/05/2016, 03:02 - Dhaani: That's easier to believe.
15/05/2016, 03:02 - Munjaal: 😂
15/05/2016, 03:02 - Munjaal: I try though
15/05/2016, 03:02 - Dhaani: 😁
15/05/2016, 03:02 - Dhaani: Why?
15/05/2016, 03:03 - Munjaal: Was curious
15/05/2016, 03:03 - Munjaal: About weather I could do it
15/05/2016, 03:03 - Munjaal: Turns out it's a little against my natural behavioral tendencies
15/05/2016, 03:07 - Dhaani: *whether
15/05/2016, 03:08 - Munjaal: Oops ..
15/05/2016, 03:08 - Dhaani: It goes more than a little against your natural behavior
15/05/2016, 03:08 - Munjaal: 😅
15/05/2016, 03:09 - Dhaani: 😅
15/05/2016, 03:09 - Munjaal: I find it tough even against people I hate
15/05/2016, 03:09 - Munjaal: For no understandable reason
15/05/2016, 03:10 - Dhaani: Because you're a nice guy
15/05/2016, 03:10 - Dhaani: Simple
15/05/2016, 03:10 - Munjaal: ..
15/05/2016, 03:10 - Munjaal: At times I wish I wasn't
15/05/2016, 03:12 - Dhaani: Don't.
15/05/2016, 03:12 - Dhaani: You'll realize eventually that it is one of the most precious things about you.
15/05/2016, 03:13 - Munjaal: 🤓
15/05/2016, 03:14 - Dhaani: It's true.
15/05/2016, 03:14 - Munjaal: ☺
15/05/2016, 03:16 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
15/05/2016, 03:16 - Dhaani: What's on your mind?
15/05/2016, 03:16 - Munjaal: Was just a thought... I'd sideline it
15/05/2016, 03:17 - Dhaani: Tell me.
15/05/2016, 03:18 - Munjaal: No , I meant that "not being nice" was a thought I'll sideline
15/05/2016, 03:18 - Munjaal: Though there is something on my mind atm.
15/05/2016, 03:19 - Dhaani: Tell me
15/05/2016, 03:19 - Munjaal: Well. . . it'd be better told in person
15/05/2016, 03:20 - Dhaani: 😐
15/05/2016, 03:21 - Dhaani: Aisa Kya hai?
15/05/2016, 03:21 - Munjaal: Nothing serious
15/05/2016, 03:21 - Munjaal: Chota mota hi hai , don't worry
15/05/2016, 03:25 - Dhaani: Bolo? Please?
15/05/2016, 07:48 - Munjaal: Multiple organ failure,no response, doctors gonna withdraw life support..
15/05/2016, 10:13 - Munjaal: Ignore my last message. The hospital is God Damn stupid
15/05/2016, 10:14 - Munjaal: I'll end up killing the hospital staff
15/05/2016, 10:14 - Dhaani: I am really sorry to hear that
15/05/2016, 10:15 - Munjaal: ..
15/05/2016, 10:15 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
15/05/2016, 10:16 - Munjaal: One doctor told us that. When we went to meet, the other doctor told us he's responding and no such action was ever, or can be, planned
15/05/2016, 10:26 - Dhaani: Ohh
15/05/2016, 10:26 - Dhaani: That's a relief though, right?
15/05/2016, 10:26 - Munjaal: From a general perspective, yes.
Front mine, not really
15/05/2016, 10:28 - Dhaani: Why so?
15/05/2016, 10:29 - Munjaal: A life like this is..well not life really
15/05/2016, 10:30 - Dhaani: That is true. But if he is responding, does that not mean he might improve?
15/05/2016, 10:32 - Munjaal: Improvement is just a technical term here. Permanent kidney failure along with impaired heart function and inability to breath will only mean pain
15/05/2016, 10:36 - Munjaal: In my opinion, such a life is torture. But I'm not the Grim Reaper. I'll let him decide
15/05/2016, 10:37 - Dhaani: I can understand what you mean...
15/05/2016, 13:03 - Munjaal: You free anytime this week ? Aise hi we'll meet up maybe
15/05/2016, 13:31 - Dhaani: Sure.
15/05/2016, 13:31 - Dhaani: Just not tomorrow.
15/05/2016, 13:31 - Dhaani: I think.
15/05/2016, 14:06 - Munjaal: Anytime is fine
15/05/2016, 14:08 - Dhaani: I'll try as soon as possible...
15/05/2016, 14:19 - Munjaal: It's not an emergency though, just normal ok
15/05/2016, 14:30 - Dhaani: Haan alright
15/05/2016, 22:28 - Munjaal: Damn I'm bored
15/05/2016, 22:28 - Dhaani: Really?
15/05/2016, 22:29 - Munjaal: Of life yeah
15/05/2016, 22:37 - Munjaal: Why the "Really?"   ?
15/05/2016, 22:42 - Dhaani: I don't know.
15/05/2016, 22:43 - Munjaal: Eh..
15/05/2016, 22:43 - Dhaani: 😅
15/05/2016, 22:43 - Munjaal: lol
15/05/2016, 22:43 - Munjaal: This is like the seventh time I'm trying to fix this pc
15/05/2016, 22:44 - Munjaal: Whatcha doing ?
15/05/2016, 22:46 - Dhaani: Completing my preference list for NITs.
15/05/2016, 22:47 - Munjaal: Busy lady
15/05/2016, 23:02 - Dhaani: What to do yaa
15/05/2016, 23:29 - Munjaal: I know..
15/05/2016, 23:30 - Dhaani: Bahhhj
15/05/2016, 23:30 - Munjaal: Even you're bored
15/05/2016, 23:30 - Dhaani: Yup. Sort of.
15/05/2016, 23:30 - Dhaani: And killer headache.
15/05/2016, 23:31 - Dhaani: But slept a lot in the afternoon and evening since I was feeling off. And headache.
15/05/2016, 23:31 - Munjaal: Don't take strain then
15/05/2016, 23:31 - Munjaal: PC screen can also cause that, experienced here
15/05/2016, 23:32 - Dhaani: Haan, I know.
15/05/2016, 23:32 - Dhaani: I avoided the laptop most of the day.
15/05/2016, 23:32 - Dhaani: Just opened it for the preference list.
15/05/2016, 23:33 - Munjaal: Work's over na now ?
15/05/2016, 23:33 - Dhaani: Yup.
15/05/2016, 23:33 - Dhaani: Lying in bed now.
15/05/2016, 23:33 - Munjaal: Phone's okay ?
15/05/2016, 23:34 - Dhaani: For a bit.
15/05/2016, 23:35 - Munjaal: I'll advice you to avoid the phone also
15/05/2016, 23:36 - Dhaani: I know.
15/05/2016, 23:36 - Dhaani: But I feel like talking.
15/05/2016, 23:36 - Dhaani: For a bit?
15/05/2016, 23:36 - Dhaani: Pleeeeeeeeaaaassssseeeee
15/05/2016, 23:37 - Munjaal: 😁 even I wanna
15/05/2016, 23:38 - Munjaal: I feel way better talking to you. There's a lot on my head otherwise
15/05/2016, 23:38 - Dhaani: 😔
15/05/2016, 23:38 - Dhaani: Have you been taking care?
15/05/2016, 23:39 - Munjaal: As much as I can. But I admit the stress is building up
15/05/2016, 23:40 - Dhaani: I can't imagine...
15/05/2016, 23:40 - Munjaal: Trust me , I don't want you to
15/05/2016, 23:41 - Dhaani: You're a great guy.
15/05/2016, 23:41 - Munjaal: 🐄
15/05/2016, 23:41 - Munjaal: 😂
15/05/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: I am going to get super protective when you find a girl. Warning you... 😜
15/05/2016, 23:42 - Munjaal: I don't think I might ...
15/05/2016, 23:42 - Dhaani: Uh huh. We'll see

15/05/2016, 23:53 - Munjaal: Uncle had come so had kept the phone aside
15/05/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: That's good.
15/05/2016, 23:53 - Dhaani: Such a good boy. 😝
15/05/2016, 23:54 - Munjaal: lol

16/05/2016, 12:36 - Dhaani: Max 90 is average. 😅
16/05/2016, 12:36 - Munjaal: Yeah.
16/05/2016, 12:37 - Munjaal: You were 130~
16/05/2016, 12:37 - Munjaal: But that's okay since you were tired. Goes that much in exercise
16/05/2016, 12:53 - Dhaani: Hmmm

16/05/2016, 22:14 - Dhaani: But just drained.
16/05/2016, 22:14 - Dhaani: Can't explain. Too much to type.
16/05/2016, 22:14 - Munjaal: I see..

16/05/2016, 22:26 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
16/05/2016, 22:26 - Munjaal: Kuch nahi
16/05/2016, 22:26 - Munjaal: Tomorrow is probably the last day.
16/05/2016, 22:27 - Munjaal: If we see no improvement and/or response... We'll take him home
16/05/2016, 22:28 - Dhaani: That's... I am sorry...
16/05/2016, 22:28 - Munjaal: No .... Don't. This time , I'd rather try to be happy
16/05/2016, 22:29 - Munjaal: He has lived a very satisfying life and to be sad would mean to be selfish.
16/05/2016, 22:33 - Dhaani: Alright.
16/05/2016, 22:33 - Munjaal: 😁
16/05/2016, 22:33 - Munjaal: Or did I say something wrong ?

17/05/2016, 16:18 - Munjaal: Been 6 hours since the meds were stopped. He's still fighting
17/05/2016, 16:18 - Dhaani: Ohkay
17/05/2016, 16:21 - Munjaal: My reaction sector is confused
17/05/2016, 16:24 - Dhaani: So is mine. 😐
17/05/2016, 18:08 - Munjaal: And thus the journey came to a halt.
17/05/2016, 18:10 - Munjaal: Old fella sure was stubborn till his last breath

23/05/2016, 00:06 - Munjaal: No actually, I could've flawed your logic there. MU has exams ongoing 😁
23/05/2016, 00:06 - Dhaani: Yes, they do. But you shrugged it off when I asked whether she is from our college. You think I didn't notice that?

23/05/2016, 00:08 - Munjaal: Nobody
23/05/2016, 00:09 - Munjaal: I don't share such stuff at all
23/05/2016, 00:09 - Dhaani: No one even knows you kind of like someone?
23/05/2016, 00:09 - Munjaal: Nah. I don't like telling people. Unless under certain circumstances
23/05/2016, 00:10 - Dhaani: Ohkay
23/05/2016, 00:10 - Dhaani: Fair enough.
23/05/2016, 00:10 - Dhaani: Ehh, did your dad or uncle ask or say anything later?

23/05/2016, 00:11 - Dhaani: Hmmm... Alright.
23/05/2016, 00:12 - Dhaani: Is there anything you want to say that I didn't give you a chance to?
23/05/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: if there's anything that I couldn't say it would be cause of me lol.
23/05/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: That's what I believe

23/05/2016, 00:45 - Munjaal: It's quite late by the way. Shouldn't you be sleeping ?
23/05/2016, 00:46 - Munjaal: I'm a night owl , you aren't
23/05/2016, 00:48 - Dhaani: I am selectively.
23/05/2016, 00:48 - Dhaani: I have days where I stay up really late.
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: Other days, I sleep off early.
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Munjaal: Hmm
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: Reason I am sleeping early these days is because I have been sleeping either in parents' room or the boutique since my grandfather is here.
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: Charging point is far away in the boutique.
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Munjaal: 😂
23/05/2016, 00:49 - Dhaani: 😅
23/05/2016, 00:50 - Munjaal: The charger is like a life line these days
23/05/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: I sleep when the battery gets low.
23/05/2016, 00:50 - Munjaal: Same here
23/05/2016, 00:50 - Dhaani: Other days, I've been up till 5 or so.
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Dhaani: On some days.
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Dhaani: Generally 2 or 3.
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: Oho .. That's what I do as well. When I'm playing
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Munjaal: Gamer life
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Dhaani: Hmmm...
23/05/2016, 00:51 - Dhaani: I have no excuse.
23/05/2016, 00:53 - Dhaani: I'll probably sleep thoda early today though.
23/05/2016, 00:54 - Dhaani: Have bodyache since yesterday.
23/05/2016, 00:54 - Dhaani: And need to get some work done in the morning.
23/05/2016, 00:54 - Munjaal: 😑 what did you do ?
23/05/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: I didn't do anything.
23/05/2016, 00:55 - Dhaani: And it isn't severe bodyache. Very mild.
23/05/2016, 00:55 - Munjaal: Haan but aise hi ?
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: Fever or something ?
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: I think it's from sleeping on a folding cot instead of a firm bed. Not used to it na.
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: Accha
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: That with exhaustion from stress, I think.
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Munjaal: Stress cause exams ?
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: And home stuff.
23/05/2016, 00:56 - Dhaani: And admissions goof ups.
23/05/2016, 00:57 - Munjaal: More goof ups ?
23/05/2016, 00:57 - Dhaani: Not exactly.
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: IIST has the written test and interview on 9th.
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: I have to be in Roorkee for counselling on 10th.
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Munjaal: 👏🏻👏🏻
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: Neither one have given the timings.
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Munjaal: Bravo
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Dhaani: So it's pretty tricky.
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Munjaal: I can't help but sing
23/05/2016, 00:58 - Munjaal: Indiaaa ...... Incredible Indiaaa
23/05/2016, 00:59 - Dhaani: Arre
23/05/2016, 00:59 - Dhaani: What does India have to do with that?
23/05/2016, 00:59 - Munjaal: Both are government institutions
23/05/2016, 00:59 - Dhaani: They're independent institutes scheduling their rounds as per their convenience.
23/05/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: Regardless of that I wouldn't really be able to easily purge the hatred I've got for this country and it's people 😁
23/05/2016, 01:01 - Dhaani: If the timings work out, I might take an early morning flight to trivandrum on 9th, give the test, take a flight to Delhi in the evening and immediately leave for Roorkee by cab. Travel through the night and get to Roorkee 10th early morning.
23/05/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: ⛏🗡🔪🗡💣
23/05/2016, 01:01 - Dhaani: 😓
23/05/2016, 01:01 - Munjaal: And that's one hectic schedule ...
23/05/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: All the best with that
23/05/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: If the timing doesn't fit, I'll skip IIST.
23/05/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: Hmm
23/05/2016, 01:02 - Dhaani: What else can I do yaa?
23/05/2016, 01:02 - Munjaal: Let's hope it does
23/05/2016, 01:03 - Dhaani: Anyway IIST has 6 seats per stream.
23/05/2016, 01:03 - Dhaani: And considering reservations, that leaves 3 seats for general.
23/05/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: Hmm
23/05/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: But you should try anyway incase you can
23/05/2016, 01:03 - Munjaal: You never know
23/05/2016, 01:05 - Dhaani: I will try if it's possible to manage both.
23/05/2016, 01:06 - Munjaal: Battery low..
23/05/2016, 01:06 - Dhaani: Sleep sleep.
23/05/2016, 01:06 - Munjaal: Naah
23/05/2016, 01:06 - Munjaal: Gaming is love , gaming is life 😎😎
23/05/2016, 01:07 - Dhaani: 🙈
23/05/2016, 01:07 - Dhaani: Useless
23/05/2016, 01:07 - Munjaal: 😁
23/05/2016, 01:08 - Munjaal: By the way, just letting you know.
In perfectly airtight okay ?
23/05/2016, 01:08 - Munjaal: OH MY GOd

23/05/2016, 01:08 - Munjaal: *alright
23/05/2016, 01:08 - Dhaani: I know.
23/05/2016, 01:09 - Munjaal: I hate my phone 😐
23/05/2016, 01:09 - Dhaani: 😅
23/05/2016, 01:09 - Dhaani: Asking you again, is there anything you wanted to say that you didn't feel comfortable with saying?
23/05/2016, 01:09 - Dhaani: And I am sorry you find yourself in this position...
23/05/2016, 01:11 - Munjaal: Ya
23/05/2016, 01:11 - Dhaani: ?
23/05/2016, 01:11 - Munjaal: "Baka go to sleep already"
23/05/2016, 01:12 - Munjaal: Now I feel satisfied ☺
23/05/2016, 01:12 - Dhaani: 😒
23/05/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: This titanium clad clockwork core of mine ain't meant for human responses ya know 🤖
23/05/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: Expect the unexpected
23/05/2016, 01:13 - Munjaal: 😜
23/05/2016, 01:13 - Dhaani: I am beginning to. 😜
23/05/2016, 01:14 - Munjaal: Besides , according to me I should be the one apologising.
23/05/2016, 01:15 - Dhaani: Why?
23/05/2016, 01:15 - Munjaal: Stepping out of bounds and character
23/05/2016, 01:16 - Dhaani: How did you do that?
23/05/2016, 01:17 - Munjaal: 2%
23/05/2016, 01:17 - Munjaal: 😅
23/05/2016, 01:17 - Munjaal: Phone won't let me explain 😋😉
23/05/2016, 01:18 - Munjaal: Goodnight
23/05/2016, 01:18 - Dhaani: Good for you. 😜
23/05/2016, 01:18 - Dhaani: Good night.
24/05/2016, 00:07 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
24/05/2016, 00:07 - Dhaani: Came across that online. Couldn't not share.
24/05/2016, 00:13 - Munjaal: 😑
24/05/2016, 00:23 - Dhaani: 😅
24/05/2016, 10:30 - Munjaal: Notice me Senpai ! 😝
24/05/2016, 10:32 - Dhaani: Hii
24/05/2016, 10:32 - Munjaal: Hola

24/05/2016, 10:32 - Munjaal: Ceiling 😛
24/05/2016, 10:32 - Dhaani: 😒
24/05/2016, 10:33 - Munjaal: 😁
24/05/2016, 10:33 - Munjaal: Sleeping is a little irritating
24/05/2016, 10:33 - Munjaal: That's all
24/05/2016, 10:34 - Dhaani: Why?
24/05/2016, 10:34 - Munjaal: Dreams are 1 thing I still can't control 😅
24/05/2016, 10:41 - Dhaani: I used to be able to. Did again once recently.
24/05/2016, 13:41 - Munjaal: Nice,
24/05/2016, 13:41 - Munjaal: I gotta improve
24/05/2016, 13:59 - Dhaani: Lucid dreaming.
24/05/2016, 13:59 - Dhaani: Unfortunate side effect is you're more prone to sleep paralysis.
24/05/2016, 13:59 - Dhaani: That's an interesting experience too though.
24/05/2016, 16:57 - Munjaal: I like it
24/05/2016, 16:57 - Munjaal: It's fun
24/05/2016, 16:58 - Munjaal: Flying around, creating things,  making NUCLEAR MISSILES and  killing people, impale stuff 😈😈😈
24/05/2016, 16:58 - Dhaani: Like what? Lucid dreaming or sleep paralysis?
24/05/2016, 17:02 - Dhaani: I just wrote 4 things.
24/05/2016, 17:03 - Dhaani: After ages.
24/05/2016, 17:06 - Munjaal: Oho
24/05/2016, 17:06 - Munjaal: Poems ?
24/05/2016, 17:25 - Dhaani: Something like.
24/05/2016, 17:31 - Munjaal: Share ??
24/05/2016, 17:31 - Munjaal: 😁
24/05/2016, 17:59 - Dhaani: Every step of the way 
Tried hard to keep them at bay 
As I struggled past my own defense. 
Slipped and stumbled countless times 
Heard warning bells in life's chimes 
Just a breath away from falling apart. 
Didn't see the distance I walked 
As my insecurities grew louder, they talked 
Of my path's impending end. 
Until my will begun to crumble and bend 
Till a voice reminded me I have to survive 
My story is winding down and I am alive 
Fought my battles 
But can't leave them behind 
My enemy lives in my mind.
24/05/2016, 17:59 - Dhaani: Thrice 
I have fallen 
Once 
I called it a mistake 
Twice 
We called it closure 
Thrice 
You called it a habit. 
Thrice 
And then I stopped keeping count.
24/05/2016, 17:59 - Dhaani: Chasing peace 
As my mind riots 
Even a murmuring stream 
Sounds like a thousand cries. 
Lose myself in the lies 
But they won't let me hide 
As they viciously confide 
Their lack of authenticity. 
Search for nothingness 
For emptiness 
For a void. 
Find meanings in blank canvasses 
Simple lines seem jagged 
Close my eyes 
And the darkness rebels 
Offering reminders 
Of all that it shelters 
Until finally overwhelmed 
I find myself numb.
24/05/2016, 17:59 - Dhaani: The nostalgia that was meant to grow sweeter with time faded away. Just another broken unspoken promise
24/05/2016, 18:01 - Munjaal: I can't help but be amazed as always...
24/05/2016, 18:03 - Munjaal: 😊😊
24/05/2016, 18:03 - Dhaani: Really?
24/05/2016, 18:03 - Dhaani: Which one?
24/05/2016, 18:03 - Munjaal: First one I like the most
24/05/2016, 18:06 - Dhaani: The others?
24/05/2016, 18:40 - Munjaal: Second I can relate to, in a way
24/05/2016, 18:41 - Munjaal: Third one me no understand 😕
24/05/2016, 18:41 - Dhaani: Really?
24/05/2016, 18:43 - Munjaal: I mean I can understand what you mean to express but not the underlying meaning well enough.
24/05/2016, 19:32 - Dhaani: Fair enough.
25/05/2016, 11:43 - Munjaal: Hello
25/05/2016, 11:47 - Dhaani: Hi.
25/05/2016, 11:47 - Munjaal: Wassup
25/05/2016, 11:56 - Dhaani: Nothing

25/05/2016, 11:57 - Dhaani: It is walking distance from prithvi!
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Munjaal: All of us are just lazing around though 😛
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Munjaal: Yup
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Dhaani: Sounds good.
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Dhaani: I have to go to someone's place for lunch.
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Munjaal: Such a drag ...
25/05/2016, 11:57 - Munjaal: I don't even wanna move..
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: I don't either
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: Thoda feverish
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: And bodyache.
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: I just want to sleep.
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Dhaani: But that's definitely not an option.
25/05/2016, 11:59 - Munjaal: You should go to a doctor
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Dhaani: Took medicine after breakfast.
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Munjaal: It's not common to have these frequent fevers are bodyaches
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Munjaal: *and
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Dhaani: Bahhh
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Dhaani: Is OK.
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Munjaal: 😐
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Dhaani: It's just stress and exhaustion.
25/05/2016, 12:00 - Munjaal: Then avoid it .... Pls
25/05/2016, 12:01 - Munjaal: A living Senpai is better than a dead one
25/05/2016, 12:01 - Dhaani: After this weekend.
25/05/2016, 12:01 - Dhaani: I won't die.
25/05/2016, 12:01 - Dhaani: If I do, I'll haunt everyone.

24/11/2016, 21:15 - Dhaani: Ello
24/11/2016, 21:15 - Munjaal: That was my auxiliary number
24/11/2016, 21:15 - Dhaani: I thought so since there is just a single digit difference but had to check
24/11/2016, 21:16 - Munjaal: Okay
24/11/2016, 21:19 - Dhaani: What's up?
24/11/2016, 21:20 - Munjaal: Had 3 exams back to back.
24/11/2016, 21:20 - Munjaal: Last one of those three tomorrow. Haven't been getting more than 4 hours of sleep

24/11/2016, 21:22 - Dhaani: 😐
24/11/2016, 21:23 - Munjaal: I'll start, have about 10 hours at hand easily
24/11/2016, 21:24 - Dhaani: Fair enough.
25/11/2016, 20:06 - Munjaal: Hello
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: Ello
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: How was the exam today.
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: *?
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Munjaal: A very funny day it was
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Dhaani: Why?
25/11/2016, 20:07 - Munjaal: I could've passed easily , easiest paper of the sem life.
25/11/2016, 20:08 - Dhaani: Could have?
25/11/2016, 20:08 - Munjaal: ~life~
25/11/2016, 20:08 - Dhaani: What happened?
25/11/2016, 20:08 - Munjaal: I actually forgot a certain conversion which is required in all numericals.
25/11/2016, 20:09 - Munjaal: So I sabotaged the paper , left 1 15 mark worth of a question and a few others incomplete so that I could fail
25/11/2016, 20:10 - Dhaani: Why would you do that?
25/11/2016, 20:10 - Munjaal: I wanted to fail but will end up passing now thanks to that bloody new 6 grace mark rule
25/11/2016, 20:10 - Dhaani: Why did you want to fail?
25/11/2016, 20:11 - Munjaal: So that I could study perfectly for re examination
25/11/2016, 20:11 - Munjaal: I honestly studied for 6 hours only and knew 75% of the paper
25/11/2016, 20:11 - Munjaal: But that 1 conversion formula
25/11/2016, 20:12 - Dhaani: 😐
25/11/2016, 20:12 - Munjaal: Ah well. Getting low in FM is like a personal shame for me
25/11/2016, 20:13 - Munjaal: So I went AllahuAkbar
25/11/2016, 20:13 - Munjaal: Classic case of trying to shoot yourself in the head but the bullet misses 😓😞
25/11/2016, 20:14 - Dhaani: It's ok. Happens.
25/11/2016, 20:14 - Dhaani: Honestly, that's how most midterms this semester have felt to me.
25/11/2016, 20:15 - Munjaal: Not going so well ?
25/11/2016, 20:15 - Dhaani: Midterms already happened na
25/11/2016, 20:15 - Dhaani: Exams start Monday.
25/11/2016, 20:16 - Dhaani: There was too much shit going on so I hardly had time to study and almost no motivation, even for subjects I used to be really good at.
25/11/2016, 20:16 - Munjaal: 😦

25/02/2017, 18:27 - Munjaal: The usual
25/02/2017, 18:31 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
25/02/2017, 18:31 - Munjaal: Nothing special
25/02/2017, 18:31 - Munjaal: Later when you have time
25/02/2017, 18:34 - Dhaani: Arre tell me.
25/02/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: Shreyas has resigned. So Anushri and I are the candidates for Team Head
25/02/2017, 18:36 - Munjaal: Anushri thinks it's more logical for me to be selected. Harish and Sir do not have similar views, and I think I shouldn't be leading anything
25/02/2017, 18:36 - Dhaani: Why did Shreyas resign?
25/02/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: Long story
25/02/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: In short he did not contribute and was gonna be removed
25/02/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: So he resigned before we could tell him
25/02/2017, 18:38 - Dhaani: Ohkay
04/03/2017, 19:22 - Munjaal: Hey , I'm sorry for messaging up randomly.
04/03/2017, 19:22 - Munjaal: Can we meet any day this week ?
04/03/2017, 19:22 - Dhaani: Of course
04/03/2017, 19:23 - Dhaani: You don't need to apologise for that
04/03/2017, 19:24 - Munjaal: Maybe not for that, but there's something for which  I think I'll need to.
04/03/2017, 19:24 - Dhaani: Tell me?
04/03/2017, 19:24 - Dhaani: You're getting me worried
04/03/2017, 19:24 - Dhaani: Are you alright?

04/03/2017, 19:26 - Munjaal: Just wanted someone out there who'd listen to me that's it.
04/03/2017, 19:26 - Munjaal: Nothing huge tbh. The common issues of a normal teenagers life
04/03/2017, 19:27 - Dhaani: Oh. OK. That's a little reassuring
04/03/2017, 19:28 - Munjaal: Don't we all assign priorities based heavily on our age groups. I mean , at 40 I might totally laugh this off
04/03/2017, 19:28 - Munjaal: 😇
04/03/2017, 19:44 - Dhaani: True
04/03/2017, 19:44 - Dhaani: But take care

04/03/2017, 19:45 - Dhaani: How's your hand?
04/03/2017, 19:46 - Munjaal: Healed long back. Was barely much. Only pains a little on the bone occasionally if there's load
04/03/2017, 19:47 - Dhaani: It isn't completely healed if it pains na

10/03/2017, 16:33 - Munjaal: Oi
10/03/2017, 16:34 - Munjaal: She's getting me along.... 😕
10/03/2017, 16:34 - Dhaani: Ohkay
10/03/2017, 16:34 - Dhaani: That's alright.
10/03/2017, 16:34 - Dhaani: I met her alone earlier today.
10/03/2017, 16:35 - Munjaal: So what do I do ?
10/03/2017, 16:35 - Dhaani: Come if you want.
10/03/2017, 16:38 - Munjaal: okay
10/03/2017, 16:44 - Dhaani: Are you coming?
10/03/2017, 18:50 - Dhaani: They saw me only as all that they needed me to be and to be fair, I was all of that. I was all of that and more. When I said as much, they closed their eyes. 
We chalked out my path but every step forward felt like I was walking away from me and I waited for someone to take my hand, tell me that they understand or to tell me they don't. But they can see and maybe feel how I feel. So I wrote and wrote from the perspective of the angel I sought but it was all for naught and my words turned to a shadecard I walked through life holding, looking for a match. 
And I found them. 
Everytime I needed someone, they appeared, they were there. Everytime I needed someone to lean on, someone to keep me going, someone to wipe my tears. 
I was never alone. 
Except when I was. When things were fine and I didn't have a burden to bear, nor a barrier to break. When I wanted to take their hand and show them the beauty they'd shown me. 
They were there when I needed them but I wanted more and that made me feel ugly. 
But that was easy to forget for when my dreams got misleading and who I was and who I wanted to be didn't get along, their voices were the only sounds that could soothe the storm that kept brewing, not quite raging yet. 
Now, when the the voices grow faint with the distance of those not quite here but not quite uncaring, I turned my memories into a lullaby that I recited like a chant in their place.
I reminded myself 
They were mine. Not to hold or control or caress or even reach. They were mine to remember, to love and to continue to believe in, and I told myself that is all I need.
10/03/2017, 22:28 - Munjaal: Are you any better ?
10/03/2017, 22:31 - Munjaal: And that is one of the most beautifully written piece I've read. 🙂
10/03/2017, 22:31 - Dhaani: You think so?
10/03/2017, 22:32 - Munjaal: Yeah. No kidding
10/03/2017, 22:32 - Dhaani: Thanks
10/03/2017, 22:32 - Munjaal: Is it from any real experience ?
10/03/2017, 22:33 - Munjaal: Or something you just felt like writing
10/03/2017, 22:33 - Dhaani: Somewhat.
10/03/2017, 22:33 - Dhaani: It was something that was spinning in my head for almost an entire weekend.
10/03/2017, 22:33 - Munjaal: Did something happen ?
10/03/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: Nahi
10/03/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Like feeling low or something ?
10/03/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: I was.
10/03/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Well, felt so. Somehow
10/03/2017, 22:35 - Dhaani: It was almost two weeks ago baba
10/03/2017, 22:35 - Dhaani: Fine now.
10/03/2017, 22:35 - Munjaal: Hmm , okay
10/03/2017, 22:36 - Munjaal: Kinda evident through the writing though

13/03/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Damn

13/03/2017, 22:36 - Munjaal: Had to type fast , sorry. I meant . Had I known earlier I could've done something.
13/03/2017, 22:36 - Dhaani: Aah. Yes, we could have.
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: But instead, I took medicine and stayed in bed.
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Made gujiyas though
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: Even Anushri didn't feel like playing today, I thought it'd be awkward so didn't do anything.
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: I'm hungry
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: 😭
13/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: I like Holi.

13/03/2017, 22:42 - Munjaal: Sick
13/03/2017, 22:42 - Munjaal: Rest was a better choice i guess
13/03/2017, 22:42 - Dhaani: I was a little unwell
13/03/2017, 22:43 - Dhaani: But it's Holi!
13/03/2017, 23:15 - Munjaal: I'm sorry was with parents

14/03/2017, 18:29 - Dhaani: It was nice enough.
14/03/2017, 18:29 - Dhaani: How was yours?
14/03/2017, 18:30 - Munjaal: As usual 👨🏻‍🔧
14/03/2017, 18:32 - Munjaal: Something strange occurred today though
14/03/2017, 18:32 - Dhaani: Strange? Tell me, tell me.
14/03/2017, 18:32 - Munjaal: 😂
14/03/2017, 18:33 - Munjaal: Randomly gave lift to a lady at the station who looked like she was in hurry.
14/03/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: I randomly initiated a conversation cause she was tensed
14/03/2017, 18:34 - Dhaani: Lift till?
14/03/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: She turned out to be my friend's elder sister 😂
14/03/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: Irla
14/03/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: The world's a small place
14/03/2017, 18:35 - Dhaani: Nice yaa
14/03/2017, 18:35 - Dhaani: It is a tiny world
14/03/2017, 18:35 - Munjaal: I'm learning from my mentor 😏
14/03/2017, 18:36 - Dhaani: Hahaha
14/03/2017, 18:36 - Dhaani: Beautiful, isn't it?
14/03/2017, 18:36 - Munjaal: Yeah
14/03/2017, 18:36 - Dhaani: 😁
14/03/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: I used to be scared of strangers.
14/03/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: They are normal people after all I guess.
14/03/2017, 18:37 - Dhaani: Why scared?
14/03/2017, 18:37 - Munjaal: Dunno.
14/03/2017, 18:38 - Munjaal: Not scared of them but of what I would predict their judgements about me would be.
14/03/2017, 18:38 - Dhaani: Arre
14/03/2017, 18:39 - Munjaal: Chill chill
14/03/2017, 18:39 - Dhaani: You're too nice to be judged after interaction.
14/03/2017, 18:40 - Munjaal: 😅
14/03/2017, 18:41 - Munjaal: * peeks out of the cacoon intriguingly *
14/03/2017, 18:41 - Dhaani: Hahaha
15/03/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: Nice pic
15/03/2017, 00:29 - Dhaani: Thanks!

24/03/2017, 07:04 - Munjaal: Tell me what you think about the video later

25/03/2017, 19:49 - Munjaal: 👍🏻👍🏻
25/03/2017, 22:30 - Dhaani: Doctor said there is no infection. Already showing improvement. I should be much better in a couple days
25/03/2017, 22:30 - Munjaal: Phew 🤞🏻
25/03/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: 😬
26/03/2017, 14:57 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
26/03/2017, 14:57 - Munjaal: For some reason, I see myself in him
26/03/2017, 14:58 - Dhaani: Why?
26/03/2017, 14:59 - Munjaal: See the gif na
26/03/2017, 15:00 - Dhaani: I did
26/03/2017, 15:01 - Munjaal: 😈 I like messing around with stuff. That's why
26/03/2017, 15:09 - Dhaani: Useless creature
26/03/2017, 15:09 - Munjaal: 👹
26/03/2017, 20:52 - Munjaal: hey
26/03/2017, 20:53 - Dhaani: Hey
26/03/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: I kinda need some help
26/03/2017, 20:53 - Dhaani: Bolo
26/03/2017, 20:54 - Munjaal: well it's a little trivial , gussa mat hona
26/03/2017, 20:54 - Dhaani: Tell me
26/03/2017, 20:56 - Munjaal: I'm leading a 4 man team (me inclusive) at Victor Tango, Anushri is also a part.
Now I wanted to hold a meeting on Thursday cause all were upto it.
There was a faculty issue and the other 2 fellas can't show up and will be meeting me earlier instead but Anushri has her exams.
Do you think I should just brief her up through text alone and finish the work on my own on thursday ?
26/03/2017, 20:57 - Munjaal: P.S: We all were gonna make a quadcopter on Thursday so.. I can complete it on my own as well
26/03/2017, 21:02 - Dhaani: Brief her over text and let her decide whether she wants to work with you?
26/03/2017, 21:13 - Munjaal: done . .thanks
26/03/2017, 22:03 - Dhaani: All else ok?
26/03/2017, 22:05 - Munjaal: yeah .. trivial as i said
26/03/2017, 22:06 - Dhaani: That's good
26/03/2017, 22:06 - Munjaal: i do overthink a lot apparently
26/03/2017, 22:06 - Munjaal: will have to work my way around
26/03/2017, 22:07 - Dhaani: That's ok
26/03/2017, 22:10 - Munjaal: Things okay at home ?
26/03/2017, 22:14 - Dhaani: Yup
27/03/2017, 09:17 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/03/2017, 09:25 - Dhaani: Hmmm
27/03/2017, 19:52 - Munjaal: Problem solved. The other 2 are showing up
27/03/2017, 19:52 - Dhaani: That's great
27/03/2017, 19:52 - Munjaal: Feeling better today !
27/03/2017, 19:52 - Munjaal: *?
27/03/2017, 20:51 - Dhaani: Much. Just easily tired
27/03/2017, 20:52 - Munjaal: Chalo , nice !
27/03/2017, 20:57 - Dhaani: Yup
29/03/2017, 14:11 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
29/03/2017, 14:34 - Munjaal: 😈😁😁
29/03/2017, 14:34 - Munjaal: That's my kind of thing now
29/03/2017, 14:35 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
29/03/2017, 14:37 - Munjaal: 😂😂
29/03/2017, 14:37 - Dhaani: 😁
29/03/2017, 14:38 - Munjaal: Things people come up with 😂
How's you ?
29/03/2017, 14:38 - Dhaani: Me ok.
29/03/2017, 14:38 - Dhaani: Though wasn't good this morning so didn't go to college.
29/03/2017, 14:39 - Munjaal: Hmm , that's okay
29/03/2017, 14:51 - Dhaani: ?
29/03/2017, 15:40 - Munjaal: I mean, it's okay to skip a day if sick
29/03/2017, 15:40 - Dhaani: I missed over a week already
29/03/2017, 15:41 - Munjaal: Medical hai toh kya tension
29/03/2017, 15:41 - Munjaal: Not like it's fake
29/03/2017, 15:41 - Dhaani: But it's getting a little hard to believe na now.
29/03/2017, 19:02 - Munjaal: Hmm
29/03/2017, 19:52 - Munjaal: You can't do much can you​ ?
29/03/2017, 19:53 - Munjaal: Still better than forcing college upon yourself when you're sick
29/03/2017, 20:06 - Dhaani: Didn't exactly stay home either. 😅
29/03/2017, 20:08 - Munjaal: That was a understandable. Home isn't exactly rest for you
29/03/2017, 20:08 - Munjaal: ~a~
29/03/2017, 20:09 - Dhaani: Yup
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Munjaal: Alpeh ?
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Dhaani: Yes.
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Munjaal: 😁
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Dhaani: Though I'll have to stop going there to rest when sick.
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Dhaani: The owner was asking me why I am always sick. 😓
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Munjaal: Hahahaha
29/03/2017, 20:10 - Munjaal: 🤣😂
29/03/2017, 20:11 - Dhaani: 🙈
29/03/2017, 21:48 - Dhaani: Oi
29/03/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: Yup
29/03/2017, 21:49 - Dhaani: So you know a little about normal heart rate and such na?
29/03/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: Yeah
29/03/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: What happened ?
29/03/2017, 21:53 - Dhaani: What's the highest heart rate that falls within the normal range while someone has been lying down in the same spot for over an hour?
29/03/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: There's no number, depends on age. For our age group , the ideal resting heart rate is around 60
29/03/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: But emotional states or stress can hugely affect that
29/03/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: Mine has gone up to 80 as well
29/03/2017, 22:30 - Dhaani: So over 100 is definitely not normal?
29/03/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: How much over 100 ?
29/03/2017, 22:36 - Dhaani: Not much around 105
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: 60 to 100 is the usual range. If it is consistently above 100 , it is called Tachycardia
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Nahi. Mine fluctuates na.
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Used to shoot up above 120 and 130
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Today it just went above 100
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: While resting ?
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Now it's in the 80s
29/03/2017, 22:37 - Dhaani: Yes
29/03/2017, 22:38 - Munjaal: Well 105 is borderline and can be overlooked. 130 is high
29/03/2017, 22:38 - Munjaal: Your app would have a history right? Check your general trend
29/03/2017, 22:38 - Dhaani: I know. I'd gone to my doctor about it.
29/03/2017, 22:38 - Dhaani: Nahi. I don't think it has history.
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Munjaal: Did you consume any caffeine or other drink ?
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Munjaal: They do increase the HR as well
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Dhaani: Nahi.
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Dhaani: Nevermind
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Dhaani: It was borderline na
29/03/2017, 22:39 - Munjaal: 105 yes
29/03/2017, 22:40 - Munjaal: Listen
29/03/2017, 22:40 - Munjaal: Heart related abnormalities can also lead to a higher HR
29/03/2017, 22:40 - Dhaani: Some of them can
29/03/2017, 22:41 - Dhaani: Mine isn't supposed to.
29/03/2017, 22:41 - Munjaal: Hmm
29/03/2017, 22:41 - Munjaal: Probably stress and anxiety
29/03/2017, 22:41 - Dhaani: Anyway, today, that's not the biggest concern.
29/03/2017, 22:41 - Munjaal: Something else happened ?
29/03/2017, 22:42 - Dhaani: I've been vomiting since last night.
29/03/2017, 22:42 - Dhaani: I told you I wasn't feeling well.
29/03/2017, 22:43 - Munjaal: I thought you were mildly unwell. Vomiting since last night is .... Well..
29/03/2017, 22:43 - Dhaani: It sounds worse than it is, honestly
29/03/2017, 22:44 - Munjaal: . I'm just trying to narrow down to a reason
29/03/2017, 22:44 - Munjaal: A cause i mean
29/03/2017, 22:47 - Munjaal: Is there anything on your mind that's bothering you?
29/03/2017, 22:48 - Dhaani: In that case, you should know that coughing fits are ending in vomiting. Not simply vomiting.
29/03/2017, 22:50 - Munjaal: Ah , you're probably vomitting because of the coughing itself then
29/03/2017, 22:50 - Dhaani: Not coughing that hard though
29/03/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: Could be somehow triggering​ a kind of gag reflex
29/03/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Guess so
29/03/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: Heavy vomitting ?
29/03/2017, 22:52 - Dhaani: Yes
29/03/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: This is weird.
29/03/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: Wait I'll call my friend , she's the Doc
29/03/2017, 22:53 - Dhaani: Arre no need for that.
29/03/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: She's like friend only re. Like you

29/03/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: There is no need na baba
29/03/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: I'll go back to my doctor if it continues
29/03/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: Hmm okay
29/03/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: Don't worry?
29/03/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: I'm not
29/03/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: Just curious
29/03/2017, 22:57 - Dhaani: Then it's fine
29/03/2017, 22:57 - Munjaal: I feel a little happy these days
29/03/2017, 23:01 - Dhaani: Why so?
29/03/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: Shields almost back to full strength 😁
29/03/2017, 23:05 - Dhaani: ?
29/03/2017, 23:45 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
29/03/2017, 23:45 - Munjaal: Impenetrable now
29/03/2017, 23:46 - Dhaani: 😓
29/03/2017, 23:46 - Munjaal: Wut? Me likes games
29/03/2017, 23:46 - Dhaani: Useless
29/03/2017, 23:47 - Munjaal: 😜 , it is because useless people exist that the useful ones are valued
29/03/2017, 23:48 - Dhaani: Ya? Know any useful ones?
29/03/2017, 23:49 - Munjaal: Yeah, you're one
29/03/2017, 23:49 - Dhaani: Nope.
29/03/2017, 23:50 - Munjaal: Well that proved me right any way 😁 , useful people are rare you see
29/03/2017, 23:52 - Dhaani: Hahaha
29/03/2017, 23:52 - Dhaani: Definitely
29/03/2017, 23:52 - Munjaal: 😜
29/03/2017, 23:53 - Dhaani: I was implying they don't exist.
29/03/2017, 23:53 - Munjaal: That's too harsh , there's definitely a few useful ones somewhere 😬
29/03/2017, 23:57 - Dhaani: Maybe
30/03/2017, 00:07 - Munjaal: Tired ?
30/03/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: Like you wouldn't believe

07/04/2017, 08:20 - Munjaal: Is it okay to ask someone if you get a feeling they're annoyed with you or mad at you ?
07/04/2017, 08:20 - Dhaani: Yes but not too often.
07/04/2017, 08:20 - Dhaani: Why?
07/04/2017, 08:21 - Munjaal: Or should you not do anything instead and wait
07/04/2017, 08:24 - Dhaani: I'd say, wait for a week
07/04/2017, 08:25 - Dhaani: They might just be irritable or preoccupied due to other things going on with them.
07/04/2017, 08:25 - Munjaal: I see. Most plausible
07/04/2017, 08:26 - Dhaani: That's the case with me most often when people think I am mad at them.
07/04/2017, 08:27 - Munjaal: I wonder how people manage to spill their work irritation on their conversations 😅, i almost never do
07/04/2017, 08:27 - Munjaal: But thanks though 🙂
07/04/2017, 08:28 - Dhaani: Anytime 😊
07/04/2017, 08:28 - Dhaani: It generally isn't work irritation in my case.
07/04/2017, 08:29 - Dhaani: When I am home, very often, I just can't pay as much attention to text conversations.
07/04/2017, 08:30 - Munjaal: Hmm
07/04/2017, 16:17 - Munjaal: You're coming today ?

07/04/2017, 20:42 - Dhaani: Ohkay.
08/04/2017, 07:30 - Munjaal: Do you have a glue gun at home by any chance ?

08/04/2017, 11:39 - Munjaal: Which was the main excuse ?
08/04/2017, 11:43 - Dhaani: Collecting my gate books from someone who'd borrowed them
08/04/2017, 11:44 - Munjaal: Hmmm
08/04/2017, 11:44 - Dhaani: He has his placecom farewell today so he isn't coming to college. 😒

09/04/2017, 01:30 - Munjaal: How is she ?
09/04/2017, 01:30 - Dhaani: She was dull initially but better by the end of it.
09/04/2017, 01:31 - Dhaani: Took her for a performed poetry event.
09/04/2017, 01:31 - Munjaal: Oho ! Nice

09/04/2017, 01:47 - Munjaal: Was i over thinking all along ?
09/04/2017, 01:48 - Dhaani: She is weighed down but I don't think it's specifically about you at all. She's just been feeling dull.
09/04/2017, 01:48 - Dhaani: It's one of those phases.
09/04/2017, 01:48 - Munjaal: I meant about her feeling low
09/04/2017, 01:51 - Dhaani: It's nothing serious baba
09/04/2017, 01:51 - Dhaani: Just one of those blah phases, as far as I see
09/04/2017, 01:51 - Dhaani: Achcha listen, I overexerted a little by going for this.

10/04/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: How was your day ?
10/04/2017, 00:05 - Dhaani: Painful.
10/04/2017, 00:05 - Munjaal: That doesn't sound good 😅
10/04/2017, 00:07 - Munjaal: What happened ?
10/04/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: Literally painful.
10/04/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: I've had a killer headache since early evening.
10/04/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: 😅
10/04/2017, 00:08 - Munjaal: You hurt yourself ? Or stress ?
10/04/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: I think over exertion. 😅
10/04/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: And I just vomited. 🙈
10/04/2017, 00:19 - Munjaal: 😶
10/04/2017, 00:21 - Munjaal: You're not gonna like die randomly or something right ?

10/04/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: Message me then, Nothing serious, sleep off if tired.
10/04/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: I could use a conversation too.
10/04/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: But too blah to think of anything.
10/04/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: Send me recent pic of the bulb? 😝
10/04/2017, 00:31 - Munjaal: Okey, gimme a min
10/04/2017, 00:33 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
10/04/2017, 00:34 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
10/04/2017, 00:34 - Dhaani: Is pretty!
10/04/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: 😋😁
10/04/2017, 00:38 - Dhaani: 😁
10/04/2017, 00:41 - Munjaal: By the way. There's some ~warnings~ insight i should give you about the Terrarium.
10/04/2017, 00:44 - Munjaal: The moss that is green right now is transplanted and thus will mostly die and mould will take over. Mould bloom is common in enclosed terrariums and they go away on their own. It's a slow process and affects only the dead organic material. Living plants won't be affected. Will look ugly for a while though
10/04/2017, 00:48 - Dhaani: That still sounds cool.
10/04/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: When do i give it though ?
10/04/2017, 00:51 - Dhaani: I don't know
10/04/2017, 00:51 - Dhaani: Whenever I can see you after giving advance notice. 😅
10/04/2017, 01:12 - Munjaal: Hmm
10/04/2017, 19:19 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
10/04/2017, 19:19 - Munjaal: XD XD
10/04/2017, 19:28 - Dhaani: 🙈

10/04/2017, 21:34 - Dhaani: Study
10/04/2017, 21:34 - Munjaal: Dry subject

15/04/2017, 10:15 - Dhaani: Otherwise, I'll try to drop by on my way back today
15/04/2017, 10:15 - Dhaani: Any idea till what time will she be around?
15/04/2017, 11:11 - Munjaal: Her time table says she has lectures till 3
15/04/2017, 11:14 - Dhaani: Oh. Ok. Thanks
15/04/2017, 14:30 - Munjaal: I'm done.Do i wait ?
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Dhaani: Nahi. I don't think I can make it
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Dhaani: Really sorry
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Munjaal: Why do you keep apologizing 😑
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Munjaal: Don't have to
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Dhaani: I know
15/04/2017, 14:31 - Dhaani: But I feel bad
15/04/2017, 14:32 - Munjaal: Well even if you did manage to show up it wouldn't have been any fruitful. She left early
15/04/2017, 14:32 - Munjaal: Just found out
15/04/2017, 14:32 - Dhaani: Ohh
15/04/2017, 14:48 - Munjaal: By the way, I shouldn't ask her anything about it right ?
15/04/2017, 19:12 - Dhaani: Nahi. Don't ask her for now.
15/04/2017, 19:12 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
16/04/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Hey there! sorry to bother you again. Did you talk to her ?
16/04/2017, 22:21 - Dhaani: Haven't been able to yaa
16/04/2017, 22:21 - Dhaani: Caught up myself
16/04/2017, 22:22 - Munjaal: I see. Is everything alright ?
16/04/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: Things are fine.
16/04/2017, 22:47 - Dhaani: I'll try to drop by on Tuesday
16/04/2017, 23:16 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
16/04/2017, 23:16 - Dhaani: Texted her.
16/04/2017, 23:38 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
16/04/2017, 23:43 - Dhaani: I am sorry
17/04/2017, 00:22 - Munjaal: Ok really now. Please stop apologizing
17/04/2017, 00:22 - Munjaal: 😑
17/04/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: I already feel kinda bad for having told you cause even you're worried
17/04/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: I haven't been there as much as I would like. 😐
17/04/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: Nah
17/04/2017, 00:24 - Dhaani: Don't feel bad
17/04/2017, 00:24 - Dhaani: She did seem to get thoda better when I was texting
17/04/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: To be honest I don't understand a thing about her anymore
17/04/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: She is keeping something to herself
17/04/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Why do you say that?
17/04/2017, 00:25 - Munjaal: That
17/04/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: First I thought she doesn't want to talk to me maybe cause .. well obvious. But then she told me she isn't talking to her friends much either (not even Akanksha)
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: And no one would hide something trivial about health.
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: It's something serious possibly
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: Seems that way.
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: I've been in her shoes.
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: Told her I'll see her this week
17/04/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: And what's worse.
17/04/2017, 00:28 - Munjaal: She has a HUGE inferiority complex.
17/04/2017, 00:28 - Munjaal: To the point it almost pisses me off.
17/04/2017, 00:28 - Dhaani: I know baba
17/04/2017, 00:28 - Dhaani: But getting angry won't help na
17/04/2017, 00:28 - Dhaani: We can help her get over it slowly.
17/04/2017, 00:29 - Munjaal: I don't get angry at her :/
17/04/2017, 00:29 - Munjaal: I've planned a few steps to tackle this
17/04/2017, 00:29 - Dhaani: How?
17/04/2017, 00:29 - Munjaal: I'll tell in 5 mins. Dad's calling
17/04/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: Back. Surrey
17/04/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: Sorry *
17/04/2017, 00:38 - Dhaani: That's alright
17/04/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: About that
17/04/2017, 00:40 - Munjaal: I was thinking that since words are not gonna have any effect (tried). I could make her realise she's worth more than she values by work. Say a project of mine in which I'd take her assistance in her forte
17/04/2017, 00:40 - Dhaani: That makes sense
17/04/2017, 00:40 - Munjaal: Considering her current self. Even that has become very difficult
17/04/2017, 00:41 - Munjaal: Do you know about Team VictorTango
17/04/2017, 00:41 - Dhaani: Yes...?
17/04/2017, 00:43 - Munjaal: When i had told her about it when it was formed. She was too enthusiastic and requested me to let her join
17/04/2017, 00:43 - Munjaal: That was the first time i saw her that interested
17/04/2017, 00:43 - Munjaal: Now she wants to quit cause she thinks she won't be of use
17/04/2017, 00:44 - Munjaal: Well it could be our fault, I'll try changing my approach towards my sub team and see if that helps
17/04/2017, 00:44 - Dhaani: I don't know enough about the situation to comment
17/04/2017, 00:45 - Munjaal: Yeah but it's a 180°
17/04/2017, 00:45 - Dhaani: 😐
17/04/2017, 00:46 - Munjaal: There's still time. I might be able to reignite that interest. Just need to align our work with her interests
17/04/2017, 00:46 - Munjaal: And with my post I've been given full freedom to do what i like , quite literally
17/04/2017, 00:47 - Dhaani: It might also be her making this excuse because with whatever health thing she has going on, she thinks she can't take responsibility.
17/04/2017, 00:48 - Munjaal: Possible. In that case I'm helpless
17/04/2017, 00:49 - Dhaani: Yup.
17/04/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: Still worth a shot
17/04/2017, 00:49 - Dhaani: True
17/04/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: Well as long as I don't know for sure I'll try what I can.
17/04/2017, 00:51 - Munjaal: And now hell breaks loose at Robocon.
17/04/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: How so?
17/04/2017, 00:53 - Munjaal: Aah Sawant sir causing trouble again.
17/04/2017, 00:54 - Munjaal: This bastard will be kicked in the ass and outta the committee for good. Were taking this to the Dean
17/04/2017, 00:54 - Dhaani: Ohkay
17/04/2017, 00:55 - Munjaal: I swear if I get my license , he's the first person I'm driving OVER
17/04/2017, 00:55 - Dhaani: Nooo
17/04/2017, 00:55 - Dhaani: Don't do that
17/04/2017, 00:55 - Munjaal: Guns then ?
17/04/2017, 00:57 - Dhaani: No.
17/04/2017, 00:57 - Dhaani: Orchestrated accident, of course.
17/04/2017, 00:58 - Munjaal: Aah .. that
17/04/2017, 00:59 - Dhaani: Yup
17/04/2017, 01:00 - Munjaal: Well. I'll need your guidance sensei 🙃
17/04/2017, 01:00 - Munjaal: 😁
17/04/2017, 01:00 - Dhaani: Anytime.
17/04/2017, 01:00 - Dhaani: 😇
17/04/2017, 01:00 - Dhaani: My kids are growing up and trying to learn. 👵🏼
17/04/2017, 01:01 - Munjaal: 👼🏻
17/04/2017, 01:01 - Munjaal: Just replace the halo with 2 horns
17/04/2017, 01:07 - Dhaani: 😁
17/04/2017, 01:09 - Munjaal: Oh ! I finally started a Ketogenic diet
17/04/2017, 01:09 - Munjaal: 0 carbs 0 sugar 0 starch
17/04/2017, 01:09 - Dhaani: 😐
17/04/2017, 01:09 - Dhaani: That no good.
17/04/2017, 01:10 - Munjaal: But i can eat a lot of cheese and paneer and milk and eggs
17/04/2017, 01:10 - Munjaal: And vegetables
17/04/2017, 01:10 - Dhaani: You do know you need carbs
17/04/2017, 01:11 - Munjaal: Not exactly. When in the ketosis phase, our body can survive on virtually 0 carbs without any issues.
17/04/2017, 01:11 - Munjaal: It converts fats to energy
17/04/2017, 01:11 - Dhaani: I get that
17/04/2017, 01:11 - Dhaani: But that doesn't sound like a smart thing to put yourself through
17/04/2017, 01:12 - Munjaal: It in fact detoxifies the body, helps loose weight and keeps you healthy both spiritually and physically
17/04/2017, 01:13 - Dhaani: That's hard to believe
17/04/2017, 01:14 - Munjaal: You'll fall asleep if i were to explain the biological mechanism involved here 😜. but got it confirmed.
17/04/2017, 01:15 - Munjaal: I'd love to tell you though. Maybe when you've got time to spare and it's not late night
17/04/2017, 01:16 - Dhaani: Some other time
17/04/2017, 01:16 - Dhaani: Preferably when I meet you
17/04/2017, 01:17 - Munjaal: Yeah. That way i can wake you up when you fall asleep and continue 😝
17/04/2017, 01:18 - Dhaani: I wouldn't fall asleep
17/04/2017, 01:18 - Munjaal: We'll see 😏
For now you should though
17/04/2017, 01:19 - Dhaani: I should
17/04/2017, 01:19 - Dhaani: So should you
17/04/2017, 01:19 - Munjaal: Yeah exam tomorrow.

Goodnight
17/04/2017, 01:20 - Dhaani: Good night
17/04/2017, 01:20 - Dhaani: All the best!
17/04/2017, 01:20 - Munjaal: Thanks 😋
17/04/2017, 01:20 - Dhaani: You should have told me earlier! I wouldn't have troubled you for so Lon
17/04/2017, 01:20 - Dhaani: *long
17/04/2017, 01:21 - Munjaal: On the contrary I felt the other way around. Was feeling quite troubled, alright now thanks to you
17/04/2017, 01:22 - Dhaani: I am glad!
17/04/2017, 14:02 - Munjaal: Hey. Sorry to bother you again 😅
17/04/2017, 14:07 - Munjaal: I really need to talk to you if possible , I'm really sorry but i need to. Anytime late is alright
17/04/2017, 14:11 - Dhaani: I'll give you a call first chance I get
17/04/2017, 14:11 - Dhaani: Or I'll come and meet you tomorrow
17/04/2017, 14:12 - Munjaal: Meet her tomorrow, but i wont be joining
17/04/2017, 14:22 - Dhaani: I can meet both of you separately
17/04/2017, 14:23 - Munjaal: okay
17/04/2017, 19:57 - Munjaal: P.S: this isn't related to her so don't worry too much
17/04/2017, 19:59 - Dhaani: I can worry about you as well na?
17/04/2017, 20:03 - Munjaal: Yeah but. Instead of being worried about both. It's only one
17/04/2017, 20:25 - Munjaal: Oh, let me highlight one more side if this guy. He has, on multiple occasions, used his mother's death to gain sympathy and get close to people.
17/04/2017, 20:27 - Dhaani: Eeesh
17/04/2017, 20:47 - Munjaal: 👆🏻 i might join. Now that i know one of my major concerns is false.
17/04/2017, 20:47 - Dhaani: Sounds good
18/04/2017, 15:40 - Munjaal: This was beyond awkward
18/04/2017, 15:40 - Munjaal: I should've stayed up
18/04/2017, 15:58 - Dhaani: Really?
18/04/2017, 15:58 - Munjaal: We spoke no more than 5 lines
18/04/2017, 15:58 - Dhaani: True
18/04/2017, 15:59 - Munjaal: I think she really would want some distance ... Dont get mad, just stating conclusions from observations
18/04/2017, 16:03 - Dhaani: Not getting mad.
18/04/2017, 16:03 - Dhaani: I was thinking I'll leave her alone till after exams anyway.
18/04/2017, 16:04 - Munjaal: I'll do that too but probably longer
18/04/2017, 21:26 - Munjaal: One last question
18/04/2017, 21:27 - Dhaani: Ask.
18/04/2017, 21:27 - Munjaal: Adi has selected me as the team head for next year.
18/04/2017, 21:28 - Munjaal: You think i should split the post in 2 ? Or let it be as it is for now
18/04/2017, 21:43 - Dhaani: You know, that'll have to be your call
18/04/2017, 21:43 - Munjaal: okay
19/04/2017, 23:22 - Munjaal: I can give you the terrarium tomorrow if you're free
20/04/2017, 00:01 - Dhaani: That should be fine.
20/04/2017, 00:01 - Dhaani: Wait, don't you have college?
20/04/2017, 00:48 - Dhaani: ?
20/04/2017, 00:48 - Munjaal: I do
20/04/2017, 00:48 - Munjaal: But kinda late
20/04/2017, 00:49 - Dhaani: Ohh
20/04/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: I'll have to check whether or not I can come to college tomorrow yaa
20/04/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: What are your timings like?
20/04/2017, 00:53 - Munjaal: 1 to 3
20/04/2017, 00:55 - Dhaani: That's not bad
20/04/2017, 01:02 - Dhaani: I'll confirm in the morning about whether or not I'll be able to drop by college tomorrow?
20/04/2017, 01:03 - Munjaal: Okay
20/04/2017, 01:03 - Dhaani: Thanks!

05/05/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: Might fail
05/05/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: You won't fail baba
05/05/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: And I had no idea that I have my maths KT tomorrow
05/05/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: Yikes

05/05/2017, 00:08 - Munjaal: The day after

07/05/2017, 13:01 - Munjaal: As I keep repeating, you really don't have to be🙂
07/05/2017, 13:12 - Dhaani: I know but this time, it's been too frequent.
07/05/2017, 13:13 - Munjaal: You'll be back to normal I'm sure 😜

09/05/2017, 00:55 - Munjaal: Holy shit that's amazing
09/05/2017, 00:55 - Dhaani: 😁
09/05/2017, 00:55 - Munjaal: Me too
09/05/2017, 00:59 - Munjaal: From the bottom though
09/05/2017, 01:00 - Dhaani: Huh?
09/05/2017, 01:01 - Munjaal: First from the bottom 😜
09/05/2017, 08:18 - Dhaani: 🙈
11/05/2017, 20:35 - Munjaal: Hey

14/05/2017, 13:01 - Munjaal: Is your mood still off ? 🙁
14/05/2017, 13:16 - Dhaani: Nahi. Not at all.
14/05/2017, 13:16 - Dhaani: Kyun?
14/05/2017, 13:19 - Munjaal: Nah, just thought.

14/05/2017, 13:24 - Munjaal: Alright
16/05/2017, 16:10 - Dhaani: Hey

16/05/2017, 18:46 - Munjaal: 😁
16/05/2017, 23:30 - Munjaal: Hey
16/05/2017, 23:31 - Dhaani: Hey
16/05/2017, 23:31 - Dhaani: So I am meeting Anushri day after. 😁
16/05/2017, 23:31 - Munjaal: Great
16/05/2017, 23:32 - Munjaal: I'm breaking my own policies but I need to show you something
16/05/2017, 23:33 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
16/05/2017, 23:33 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
16/05/2017, 23:34 - Dhaani: Let's see
16/05/2017, 23:34 - Dhaani: Let me meet her day after and figure out.
16/05/2017, 23:35 - Munjaal: Okay
16/05/2017, 23:36 - Dhaani: I'll try my best
16/05/2017, 23:38 - Munjaal: Don't overexert yourself. Although quite useless most of the time I can provide some assistance
16/05/2017, 23:43 - Dhaani: No overexertion baba
17/05/2017, 02:04 - Munjaal: Well. In any case lemme know if I can be of use.
17/05/2017, 08:52 - Dhaani: Will do. Don't worry so much baba
18/05/2017, 15:52 - Munjaal: Hey
18/05/2017, 15:52 - Munjaal: Message me up na when you're free ?
18/05/2017, 16:07 - Dhaani: Ello
18/05/2017, 16:08 - Munjaal: Hi
18/05/2017, 16:08 - Munjaal: Umm, not occupied na ?
18/05/2017, 16:09 - Dhaani: Nahi. Bolo
18/05/2017, 16:10 - Munjaal: Well. Due to issues with the mentors and hod. This team of Robocon might be coming to an end.
18/05/2017, 16:10 - Munjaal: Had a talk with the HoD
18/05/2017, 16:10 - Dhaani: How? What happened?
18/05/2017, 16:11 - Munjaal: I'll see if it is negotiable. The HoD has called for a joint meet with a few core team members and the 3 mentors to decide.
18/05/2017, 16:12 - Dhaani: What's the issue though?
18/05/2017, 16:12 - Munjaal: She's being unreasonable and demands the formation of a whole new team as we are "underperforming" and since we're against Sawant
18/05/2017, 16:12 - Dhaani: How are you guys underperforming?
18/05/2017, 16:12 - Munjaal: According to her we're only getting the MATLAB second place and not working hard towards the actual competition
18/05/2017, 16:13 - Dhaani: 😓
18/05/2017, 16:13 - Munjaal: Well I can try and handle the meeting.
18/05/2017, 16:14 - Munjaal: Will try my best for a better outcome. But there's a small advice I need from you
18/05/2017, 16:14 - Dhaani: Tell me
18/05/2017, 16:15 - Munjaal: There's only 3 people who know about this. And I've told them to keep it that way.
18/05/2017, 16:15 - Dhaani: Ohkay
18/05/2017, 16:16 - Munjaal: However it won't be right on my part to not let Anushri know about this. She's as important in the core as anyone else. But she isn't herself either.
18/05/2017, 16:16 - Dhaani: Right.
18/05/2017, 16:16 - Dhaani: She seems better.
18/05/2017, 16:16 - Dhaani: I just spoke to her. Will meet her tomorrow, if possible.
18/05/2017, 16:16 - Munjaal: If I tell her, I'm an asshole for not considering her state. If I don't,  I'm as asshole for pushing her away from the committee
18/05/2017, 16:17 - Dhaani: I think she'd prefer being told.
18/05/2017, 16:17 - Munjaal: :/ okay
18/05/2017, 16:36 - Munjaal: Thanks
18/05/2017, 16:37 - Dhaani: Anytime baba
18/05/2017, 16:39 - Munjaal: Well she was unreasonably mad and very disappointed at first
18/05/2017, 16:39 - Munjaal: Better after things are clear
18/05/2017, 16:39 - Dhaani: And then?
19/05/2017, 17:39 - Munjaal: Hello. You kinda looked a little tired today
19/05/2017, 17:51 - Dhaani: Got thoda tired this morning.
19/05/2017, 17:52 - Dhaani: Plus it was really hot
19/05/2017, 17:52 - Dhaani: And I climbed the stairs. 😅
19/05/2017, 17:52 - Munjaal: Accha
19/05/2017, 17:53 - Munjaal: I swear to god this weather is getting more and more retarded by the day
19/05/2017, 17:53 - Dhaani: I know!
19/05/2017, 22:32 - Munjaal: So the team's out. No more Robocon that is.
19/05/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: Yikes
19/05/2017, 22:35 - Munjaal: This is better any way
19/05/2017, 22:35 - Munjaal: We will start afresh with the same people but probably a new competition
19/05/2017, 22:48 - Dhaani: Aah. Fair enough.
23/05/2017, 19:35 - Munjaal: Hey
23/05/2017, 19:35 - Munjaal: I'm sorry I couldn't pick up
23/05/2017, 20:00 - Dhaani: That's alright
23/05/2017, 20:45 - Munjaal: What's up ?
23/05/2017, 20:46 - Dhaani: Nothing yaa
23/05/2017, 20:46 - Dhaani: You tell me
23/05/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Been trying to study with little success
23/05/2017, 22:35 - Munjaal: Messed up
23/05/2017, 22:36 - Dhaani: Why? What's going on?
23/05/2017, 22:36 - Munjaal: Exams coming up
23/05/2017, 22:38 - Munjaal: and my usual over thinking tendencies
23/05/2017, 22:38 - Dhaani: Overthinking about what?
23/05/2017, 22:39 - Munjaal: A friend of mine is acting outta character and weird now
24/05/2017, 00:13 - Munjaal: Just home. Couldn't talk much cause my friend was there

01/06/2017, 11:33 - Munjaal: Anushri's internship started today onwards. 9 to 5 ish, bout the same time as my exam and not too far from my place. You think it'll be a good idea to ask and meet her ?
01/06/2017, 11:34 - Dhaani: Depends on how she has been behaving with you lately
01/06/2017, 11:34 - Munjaal: Lel I wish I understood 😅
01/06/2017, 11:42 - Dhaani: 😐
01/06/2017, 11:42 - Dhaani: Then I can't really give you any advice na
01/06/2017, 11:42 - Munjaal: Sorry. Nevermind me 😜

01/06/2017, 11:50 - Dhaani: 😒
01/06/2017, 11:50 - Dhaani: Study na
01/06/2017, 11:50 - Munjaal: Can't . No notes. No textbook properly covers the topics either
01/06/2017, 11:50 - Munjaal: And shitty faculty
01/06/2017, 11:50 - Munjaal: Majority of my class failed
01/06/2017, 11:52 - Dhaani: Which subject?

01/06/2017, 12:16 - Dhaani: Should have told me earlier!

01/06/2017, 12:20 - Dhaani: That's great.
01/06/2017, 12:20 - Munjaal: This one is retarded
01/06/2017, 12:21 - Dhaani: I know. I gave that paper.
01/06/2017, 12:21 - Dhaani: But, wouldn't that make you want to give fewer exams in that subject.
01/06/2017, 12:21 - Munjaal: Yeah.
03/06/2017, 12:21 - Dhaani: Hello, I'm June. I was found in Belapur 15 days back. I was malnourished but I was fostered by a human who was very kind and loving. I won't have a home in the next 2 days. I'm looking for a permanent home. I'm a very happy kitty. I was litter trained on the 1st day itself. Just give me a nice space and good food, I'll be happier!

03/06/2017, 12:24 - Dhaani: What?
03/06/2017, 12:25 - Munjaal: As much as I'd like to keep a pet. I won't take care of it 😜. I'll look if there's someone willing to adopt it though
03/06/2017, 12:25 - Dhaani: Yup. Forward it.
04/06/2017, 23:50 - Dhaani: Oi.

05/06/2017, 10:05 - Dhaani: Arre
05/06/2017, 10:05 - Dhaani: If I keep calling you in the middle of the night, you'll be stuck answering lots of questions from your friends.
05/06/2017, 10:06 - Munjaal: Nah. 3 of em know you. Don't care about the one that doesn't
05/06/2017, 10:06 - Dhaani: Aah. Fair enough
05/06/2017, 10:06 - Dhaani: Still wouldn't want to disturb na. You deserve a vacation
05/06/2017, 10:07 - Munjaal: It's fun here. A quiet life. But you know I'm like the wrong person for this place 😅
05/06/2017, 10:07 - Munjaal: Neither do I drink nor do I like clubbing or dancing 😛
05/06/2017, 10:08 - Dhaani: I can imagine. I was never tempted to go to Goa for that reason.
05/06/2017, 10:08 - Munjaal: Yup. So far we've only roamed about different beaches and locations
05/06/2017, 10:11 - Dhaani: That sounds nice in itself
05/06/2017, 10:11 - Dhaani: Just to roam around and relax
05/06/2017, 10:12 - Munjaal: Yup ☺
05/06/2017, 10:22 - Dhaani: So tiny bit of bad news.
05/06/2017, 10:38 - Munjaal: What happened ??
05/06/2017, 10:40 - Dhaani: I can't come on Anushri's birthday. We will have a lot for guests on Saturday.
05/06/2017, 10:41 - Munjaal: That's okay. We weren't supposed to go on Saturday anyway
05/06/2017, 10:41 - Munjaal: She won't be free either.
05/06/2017, 10:44 - Dhaani: Oh
05/06/2017, 10:45 - Munjaal: well even if she were free. I'd be dead trying to complete her gift in just 1 day that to directly after my trip 😅
05/06/2017, 10:44 - Dhaani: So what's the plan?
05/06/2017, 10:46 - Dhaani: Right
05/06/2017, 10:46 - Munjaal: I've asked her if she's getting free anytime after Sunday. She'll let me know
05/06/2017, 10:47 - Dhaani: After Sunday?
05/06/2017, 10:47 - Munjaal: Hey internship is in Malad. Any chance you could drop by ?
05/06/2017, 10:47 - Dhaani: Wouldn't that be the next week then?
05/06/2017, 10:47 - Dhaani: I don't know. Let's see
05/06/2017, 10:49 - Munjaal: She's busy on both the weekend days. 😞 That's why

06/06/2017, 02:28 - Dhaani: 😓
06/06/2017, 02:28 - Munjaal: My complexion is red now. Literally.
06/06/2017, 02:28 - Dhaani: Not if you put it on a little in advance. And in larger quantities
06/06/2017, 02:29 - Munjaal: Hmm. Didn't think much through
06/06/2017, 02:32 - Dhaani: Of course you didn't.

08/06/2017, 09:25 - Dhaani: Teach me!
08/06/2017, 09:25 - Dhaani: But more than that, take care!

08/06/2017, 09:29 - Dhaani: Yessssss

09/06/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: I don't think I'll be making the gift
09/06/2017, 14:58 - Dhaani: Kyun?
09/06/2017, 14:59 - Munjaal: Multiple sources logically convincing me that it's not a good idea
09/06/2017, 15:01 - Dhaani: Fair enough.
09/06/2017, 15:01 - Dhaani: Doing anything for her birthday though?
09/06/2017, 15:01 - Munjaal: I don't think so. I might not show up either

03/07/2017, 14:18 - Dhaani: I crosscheck the reading by checking my pulse the old way. This app is pretty accurate.
03/07/2017, 14:18 - Munjaal: What is the name of this one ?
03/07/2017, 14:19 - Dhaani: Instant heart rate
03/07/2017, 14:20 - Munjaal: Okay. Gimme a min. Getting the cracked version

03/07/2017, 14:27 - Dhaani: Kya?
03/07/2017, 14:28 - Dhaani: Nahi.
03/07/2017, 14:28 - Munjaal: I was doubting the app that's why I gave the link
03/07/2017, 14:28 - Dhaani: At that point, I had just walked very slowly for 15 minutes.
03/07/2017, 14:28 - Dhaani: Before I started walking, I was already uneasy.
03/07/2017, 14:28 - Dhaani: And my heart rate has gone this far up before. And it felt about the same.
03/07/2017, 14:29 - Munjaal: 😥
03/07/2017, 14:29 - Dhaani: Anyway, it has come down now

03/07/2017, 14:34 - Munjaal: 160 is a little *not* okay.
03/07/2017, 14:35 - Dhaani: I told you it has settled. Came down to 80 something last I checked.
03/07/2017, 14:35 - Munjaal: That's okay
03/07/2017, 14:35 - Munjaal: But it shooting that up is weird
03/07/2017, 14:35 - Munjaal: People don't hit 160 during HIIT
03/07/2017, 14:36 - Dhaani: HIIT?
03/07/2017, 14:36 - Munjaal: High Intensity Interval Training
03/07/2017, 14:36 - Dhaani: What is that?

03/07/2017, 14:36 - Munjaal: It is to maximise fat burn and muscle hypertrophy
03/07/2017, 14:37 - Dhaani: Huh
03/07/2017, 14:37 - Dhaani: Ya, a slow walk probably shouldn't take me there.
03/07/2017, 14:37 - Dhaani: But I was already at 120 when I got off the train. Which is when I had been sitting and the train was fairly empty.
03/07/2017, 14:38 - Munjaal: 120 when sitting 😐 your body just forgot how to be normal I guess
03/07/2017, 14:38 - Dhaani: Yup.
03/07/2017, 14:39 - Dhaani: It went 120-160-92-132-82
03/07/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
03/07/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: This is resting Heart rate
03/07/2017, 14:40 - Dhaani: 82 is fine na?
03/07/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: This is your heart in disco mode
03/07/2017, 14:41 - Dhaani: Seems that way. 😅
03/07/2017, 14:41 - Munjaal: 😜
03/07/2017, 14:41 - Munjaal: By the way. You weren't thinking about something or someone incident were you ?
03/07/2017, 14:41 - Dhaani: Considering asking my guide if I can leave early today.
03/07/2017, 14:41 - Munjaal: Perhaps in the back of your mind
03/07/2017, 14:42 - Munjaal: *some incident
03/07/2017, 14:42 - Dhaani: Nahi. Not consciously anyway.
03/07/2017, 14:42 - Munjaal: It happens to me when I do that. Not so extreme but it does cross 100
03/07/2017, 14:42 - Dhaani: But I want stressed this morning
03/07/2017, 14:43 - Dhaani: I just realized something was wrong because I was having trouble breathing normally and my head felt funny
03/07/2017, 14:43 - Munjaal: Oh
03/07/2017, 14:45 - Munjaal: By the way. You don't have thyroid issues na ?
03/07/2017, 14:45 - Dhaani: Nope
03/07/2017, 14:45 - Dhaani: Please tell me you won't spend the rest of the afternoon looking into possible reasons
03/07/2017, 14:46 - Munjaal: 😅 already am
03/07/2017, 14:46 - Dhaani: So stop.
03/07/2017, 14:47 - Munjaal: 🙇🏻ok
03/07/2017, 14:47 - Dhaani: Hahaha
03/07/2017, 14:47 - Dhaani: I have a bad feeling you didn't listen to me.
03/07/2017, 14:48 - Munjaal: No no I did, I am very obedient 😈
03/07/2017, 14:49 - Dhaani: Hahaha
03/07/2017, 14:49 - Dhaani: What are your thoughts on this?
03/07/2017, 14:51 - Munjaal: Do you think you'll be able to rest a home even if you leave early ?
03/07/2017, 14:51 - Dhaani: Won't go home.
03/07/2017, 14:51 - Dhaani: Either to Aleph or a friend's place.
03/07/2017, 14:51 - Munjaal: Hmm
03/07/2017, 14:51 - Munjaal: Go for it. See if he allows
03/07/2017, 14:52 - Munjaal: A sane person probably would
03/07/2017, 14:52 - Dhaani: But I'll have to tell her why
03/07/2017, 14:53 - Dhaani: And that always makes me feel like I am looking for attention or sympathy.
03/07/2017, 14:55 - Munjaal: 😑
03/07/2017, 14:55 - Munjaal: This is a genuine reason
03/07/2017, 14:55 - Munjaal: With a proof
03/07/2017, 14:56 - Dhaani: That my pulse shot up and so I am thoda woozy?
03/07/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: Unless she has the medical sense of a dead mongoose, she'd know 160 is no joke
03/07/2017, 14:58 - Munjaal: Don't wanna scare you but some forms of Tachycardia in their extremes can be ~lethal~ dangerous
03/07/2017, 14:58 - Dhaani: I am not telling her 160. She will ask me why I didn't leave immediately. And she'll think I am exaggerating.
03/07/2017, 14:59 - Munjaal: Try asking her for a break instead
03/07/2017, 15:00 - Dhaani: She left the lab. Let her come back
03/07/2017, 15:08 - Munjaal: Okay
03/07/2017, 16:07 - Munjaal: What's the status ?
03/07/2017, 16:08 - Dhaani: Still in the lab. 😅
03/07/2017, 16:08 - Munjaal: 😓
03/07/2017, 16:08 - Munjaal: You didn't ask na ?
03/07/2017, 16:08 - Dhaani: I don't feel like asking her
03/07/2017, 16:08 - Munjaal: Okay
03/07/2017, 16:09 - Dhaani: I should though. Before the 5pm rush hits.
03/07/2017, 16:09 - Munjaal: If it does hit the rush time. Book a cab
03/07/2017, 16:16 - Dhaani: Ok
04/07/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: Oi
04/07/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: Listen
04/07/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: Please be awake.
04/07/2017, 00:22 - Munjaal: yeah
04/07/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: im always up lol
04/07/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: Don't judge me?
04/07/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: 🙈
04/07/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: kya hua
04/07/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: Between things going on at home for the past few days and my state today, I haven't gotten much work done.
04/07/2017, 00:24 - Dhaani: If I share the ecg data files with you, can you tell me how to plot those?
04/07/2017, 00:25 - Munjaal: I can try
04/07/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Specifically just that.
04/07/2017, 00:25 - Munjaal: When do you need em
04/07/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: I have my meeting tomorrow at noon.
04/07/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: I also need to go through some research papers by then.
04/07/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: Mail them to me
04/07/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: munjaal7@gmail.com
04/07/2017, 00:32 - Dhaani: Mind if I share them using Google drive?
04/07/2017, 00:54 - Dhaani: ??
04/07/2017, 01:26 - Munjaal: yeah
04/07/2017, 01:27 - Munjaal: sorry i just recieved the message
04/07/2017, 01:28 - Dhaani: Shared the files.
04/07/2017, 01:28 - Munjaal: which ones do i have to use
04/07/2017, 01:28 - Dhaani: Any from the first folder?
04/07/2017, 01:28 - Dhaani: Or the third folder.
04/07/2017, 01:29 - Munjaal: okay
04/07/2017, 01:29 - Dhaani: The data should be in the same format in all of them.
04/07/2017, 01:29 - Munjaal: yeah , float numbers
04/07/2017, 01:29 - Dhaani: Yup.
04/07/2017, 01:45 - Munjaal: so like , do i send you the code ?
04/07/2017, 01:45 - Munjaal: or the plotted graphs
04/07/2017, 01:50 - Munjaal: the code is like 4 lines
04/07/2017, 01:52 - Dhaani: Both?
04/07/2017, 01:53 - Dhaani: And thank you so much for this!
04/07/2017, 01:53 - Munjaal: -_- , this was barely something
04/07/2017, 01:53 - Munjaal: like really
04/07/2017, 01:53 - Dhaani: Even better. Won't weigh too heavily on my conscience. 😅
04/07/2017, 01:54 - Dhaani: And it's barely anything to you. It's a lifesaver to me.
04/07/2017, 01:54 - Munjaal: :P
04/07/2017, 01:54 - Munjaal: wait I'll make the code a little more user friendly before sending
04/07/2017, 01:54 - Dhaani: Thanks!
04/07/2017, 01:57 - Dhaani: Oh and if possible, could you send me a couple very basic random codes that I could have done for python practice for an absolute beginner?
04/07/2017, 01:58 - Dhaani: Don't if you don't have time. And don't reduce sleep time for that, ok?
04/07/2017, 01:58 - Dhaani: I am sleeping. Head spinning too much now.
04/07/2017, 03:11 - Munjaal: I've uploaded 2 files in 2 of your folders each (files and filtered files) on the drive
04/07/2017, 03:11 - Munjaal: One of them
Plot.py is an iterative program that will ask you for an input filename
04/07/2017, 03:12 - Munjaal: enter the filename (without the extension example: pf10)
04/07/2017, 03:12 - Munjaal: it will ask you whether you want to save the graph as a pdf or not ? you can choose either option with 'y' or 'n'
04/07/2017, 03:13 - Munjaal: after the above entry it will show you the plotted graph
04/07/2017, 03:13 - Munjaal: if you wish to generate the pdf for all the files in the directory. Use GenerateGraphsPDF.py
04/07/2017, 03:13 - Munjaal: it will plot all the files and save them in their respective PDFs
04/07/2017, 03:15 - Munjaal: Call me up if you have a doubt or need help in understanding the code.
04/07/2017, 03:15 - Munjaal: in case I don't pick up , call on 022 28060570
04/07/2017, 03:18 - Munjaal: Oh and both the py files need to be in the directory along with the ecg files to work, following the same folder structure as on the drive.
04/07/2017, 20:51 - Dhaani: Did it get sorted?
04/07/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: She didn't pick up the phone
04/07/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: Have to do tomorrow morning
04/07/2017, 20:53 - Dhaani: Left a message?
04/07/2017, 20:53 - Dhaani: Yes, do that.

05/07/2017, 18:25 - Dhaani: He didn't agree?
05/07/2017, 18:30 - Munjaal: Nope
05/07/2017, 18:33 - Dhaani: 😐
05/07/2017, 18:33 - Dhaani: What did he say?
05/07/2017, 18:34 - Munjaal: So he writes "Regret" and puts his initials
05/07/2017, 18:34 - Dhaani: 😐
05/07/2017, 21:53 - Munjaal: Hey
05/07/2017, 21:53 - Munjaal: I need some help again if you're free
05/07/2017, 22:23 - Dhaani: Bolo

07/07/2017, 11:02 - Munjaal: There ?
07/07/2017, 11:14 - Dhaani: Yes.

07/07/2017, 11:20 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/07/2017, 12:01 - Dhaani: A little too harsh for someone trying to make a request
07/07/2017, 12:01 - Munjaal: No longer a request
07/07/2017, 12:01 - Munjaal: Pointing out the facts
07/07/2017, 12:05 - Munjaal: Frankly I don't even want them to forgive me.
07/07/2017, 12:05 - Munjaal: I'd be better off taking the drop then beg them everyday
07/07/2017, 12:06 - Munjaal: But parents
07/07/2017, 12:06 - Dhaani: 😐
07/07/2017, 12:06 - Munjaal: *than

16/07/2017, 22:25 - Munjaal: Nah
16/07/2017, 22:26 - Munjaal: It'll take time I think
16/07/2017, 22:27 - Dhaani: Fair enough
16/07/2017, 22:32 - Munjaal: What are you doing ?
16/07/2017, 22:33 - Dhaani: Waiting for mum to wind up work so I can but my bed in the boutique. 😅
16/07/2017, 22:33 - Munjaal: lol
16/07/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Then I'll bother you for some more time 😅
16/07/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: What about you?
16/07/2017, 22:34 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
16/07/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Shaurya suggests that I have a talk will Anushri about Arnav
16/07/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Get it cleared
16/07/2017, 22:40 - Dhaani: Alright. So?
16/07/2017, 22:40 - Munjaal: Thought I should let you know
16/07/2017, 22:40 - Dhaani: Baba, what part of this are you apprehensive about?
16/07/2017, 22:42 - Munjaal: I dunno, just wanted confirmation from you that it isn't a maniacal idea
16/07/2017, 22:44 - Dhaani: It isn't.
16/07/2017, 22:44 - Dhaani: Relax.
16/07/2017, 22:45 - Munjaal: Thanks
16/07/2017, 22:45 - Dhaani: Anytime.

17/07/2017, 16:40 - Dhaani: Yes, that's part of what I was worried about
17/07/2017, 16:40 - Dhaani: Who took care of you?
17/07/2017, 16:40 - Dhaani: What did you do after?
17/07/2017, 16:41 - Dhaani: Where are you now?

19/07/2017, 19:53 - Munjaal: Ohh
19/07/2017, 19:53 - Munjaal: That must've been awkward
19/07/2017, 20:01 - Dhaani: It was.
24/07/2017, 08:07 - Dhaani: Hey. Listen, I am really sorry to ask this of you but can you please do one last thing for me on python?
24/07/2017, 08:08 - Munjaal: Sure....
24/07/2017, 08:09 - Munjaal: You don't need to feel bad when asking me for that. You know right ?
24/07/2017, 08:13 - Dhaani: You remember the ecg files I had shared with you na? I need to make a heart rate monitor for that. Essentially, I peak detector with a minimum peak threshold and then calculating the heart rate with the help of the sampling frequency
24/07/2017, 08:13 - Dhaani: The sampling frequency is 500Hz.
24/07/2017, 08:16 - Munjaal: Okay
24/07/2017, 08:19 - Dhaani: You'll do it?
24/07/2017, 08:19 - Munjaal: Yeah
24/07/2017, 08:19 - Munjaal: By when do you need it ?
24/07/2017, 08:19 - Dhaani: Thank you!
24/07/2017, 08:19 - Munjaal: 😑
24/07/2017, 08:20 - Dhaani: How long will it take?
24/07/2017, 08:20 - Munjaal: About a day or 2 max
24/07/2017, 08:24 - Dhaani: Preferably I need it by noon tomorrow
24/07/2017, 08:25 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
24/07/2017, 08:25 - Dhaani: Thanks a lot!

24/07/2017, 23:44 - Dhaani: Oi
25/07/2017, 00:07 - Dhaani: Let me know about the heart rate monitor?
25/07/2017, 08:56 - Dhaani: Hey... Good morning
25/07/2017, 11:20 - Munjaal: It's not complete yet
25/07/2017, 11:20 - Munjaal: Was at Shaurya's place
25/07/2017, 11:20 - Munjaal: Couldn't complete there

25/07/2017, 11:24 - Dhaani: Thanks a lot
25/07/2017, 11:24 - Dhaani: But it's ok if you can't manage. Don't go out of your way?
25/07/2017, 13:18 - Dhaani: Did you manage to?
25/07/2017, 13:36 - Munjaal: Nope
25/07/2017, 13:36 - Munjaal: No lab here
25/07/2017, 13:36 - Dhaani: Alright
26/07/2017, 20:24 - Dhaani: Oi
26/07/2017, 20:25 - Dhaani: I am sorry I am pestering you about this
26/07/2017, 20:25 - Munjaal: I was just gonna text you lol
26/07/2017, 20:25 - Munjaal: I'll send it in an hour. Just starting my lappy
26/07/2017, 20:25 - Dhaani: Thank you!
26/07/2017, 20:26 - Munjaal: 😑
26/07/2017, 20:26 - Munjaal: You never learn
26/07/2017, 23:36 - Dhaani: Mum is coming to my room.
27/07/2017, 00:16 - Munjaal: Hmm
27/07/2017, 10:12 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/07/2017, 10:43 - Dhaani: 😁
29/07/2017, 14:53 - Munjaal: Hello
29/07/2017, 14:53 - Dhaani: Ello
29/07/2017, 14:53 - Munjaal: What's up ?

29/07/2017, 14:53 - Dhaani: Nahi
29/07/2017, 14:54 - Dhaani: At home
29/07/2017, 14:54 - Munjaal: Okay
29/07/2017, 14:54 - Munjaal: Just randomly messaged 😛
29/07/2017, 14:55 - Dhaani: What's up?
29/07/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: Bleh
29/07/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: Bored at college
30/07/2017, 21:29 - Munjaal: Hello
30/07/2017, 21:31 - Dhaani: Hey
30/07/2017, 21:33 - Munjaal: Back home
30/07/2017, 21:36 - Dhaani: Had a nice time?
30/07/2017, 21:37 - Munjaal: Umm. I guess yeah somewhat
30/07/2017, 21:37 - Dhaani: Oh
30/07/2017, 21:37 - Dhaani: *Ohkay
30/07/2017, 21:39 - Munjaal: When 2 depressed friends meet. They are depressed together 😛
30/07/2017, 21:39 - Dhaani: 😓
30/07/2017, 21:39 - Munjaal: Hehe
30/07/2017, 21:42 - Munjaal: Did the program work ?
30/07/2017, 21:46 - Dhaani: Yup
30/07/2017, 21:46 - Dhaani: Though I need to redo it with wavelets
30/07/2017, 21:46 - Dhaani: To identify the qrs complex.
30/07/2017, 21:47 - Munjaal: I have no idea that is
30/07/2017, 21:48 - Dhaani: Ya, I know. It's ok.
30/07/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: Wavelet transform to analyse different peaks in the rhythm ?
30/07/2017, 21:53 - Dhaani: Yes.
30/07/2017, 22:00 - Munjaal: Hmmm
30/07/2017, 22:02 - Munjaal: Scipy has wavelet transform function
30/07/2017, 23:05 - Munjaal: Ate entire dinner in 5 mins 😂
31/07/2017, 23:43 - Munjaal: So I just had a 180mg caffeine shot
31/07/2017, 23:47 - Dhaani: Why?
31/07/2017, 23:56 - Munjaal: Helps muscle recovery, increases metabolism, good for exercise
31/07/2017, 23:57 - Munjaal: Arms are kinda sore from workout
31/07/2017, 23:58 - Dhaani: Ohkay
01/08/2017, 03:12 - Munjaal: Worst fucking idea to drink it that late. My brain is on hyperdrive. Can't think straight. Thinking too fast and random shit. Can't sleep. Irregular heart rates. Damn it all. 🤢
01/08/2017, 03:12 - Dhaani: I can't sleep either tonight
01/08/2017, 03:13 - Dhaani: And I have a long day tomorrow.
01/08/2017, 03:13 - Munjaal: Samee
01/08/2017, 03:13 - Dhaani: Leave home at 7:30
01/08/2017, 03:13 - Dhaani: Conducting a lab at VJTI from 9-11
01/08/2017, 03:13 - Dhaani: Then I'll be heading to Vikhroli to work
01/08/2017, 03:14 - Dhaani: Should get there by 12:30, even taking into account that I will also eat something between the two.
01/08/2017, 03:15 - Munjaal: You do take a Dabba na ?
01/08/2017, 03:15 - Dhaani: Ya. But I'll have my dabba at 2:30 during lunch break at work.
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Dhaani: Must space out my meals na.
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Munjaal: My brain's gonna explode all over 😖
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Munjaal: Sorry ignore
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Dhaani: Not supposed to go 3 hours without some food intake.
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Munjaal: Carry a snack packet or snack bar
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Munjaal: It's handy
01/08/2017, 03:16 - Dhaani: Then don't pull this crap again. No caffiene shots.
01/08/2017, 03:17 - Dhaani: I always do na
01/08/2017, 03:17 - Munjaal: The timing was wrong. They explicitly mentioned avoid beyond 6pm
01/08/2017, 03:17 - Munjaal: I took it at 12
01/08/2017, 03:17 - Dhaani: You're impossible
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Dhaani: I am considering not sleeping tonight. Mind is in overdrive anyway.
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Dhaani: Won't be able to sleep for at least another hour.
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Munjaal: Did you drink extra coffee as well ? 😂
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Dhaani: And then, if I sleep, there is no way I'll wake up.
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Dhaani: Nope.
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Dhaani: No idea why yaa
01/08/2017, 03:18 - Munjaal: Something bothering you ?
01/08/2017, 03:19 - Munjaal: Perhaps your crazy side just decided to surface today for a while
01/08/2017, 03:19 - Dhaani: Something like that.
01/08/2017, 03:20 - Munjaal: lol
01/08/2017, 03:20 - Munjaal: So what are you doing ? Not sleeping is one
01/08/2017, 03:21 - Dhaani: Reading
01/08/2017, 03:21 - Munjaal: Hmm
01/08/2017, 03:24 - Dhaani: What about you?
01/08/2017, 03:24 - Munjaal: Trying to you know "not throw up or explode mentally"
01/08/2017, 03:25 - Dhaani: I might implode.
01/08/2017, 03:26 - Munjaal: So I was on a thought train for about an hour and then I checked my phone
01/08/2017, 03:26 - Munjaal: It was 5 mins
01/08/2017, 03:26 - Munjaal: 🙂🔫
01/08/2017, 03:26 - Dhaani: Happens
01/08/2017, 03:27 - Munjaal: Teleport here or something
01/08/2017, 03:27 - Dhaani: If I could be out right now, I'd be wandering the roads aimlessly
01/08/2017, 03:28 - Munjaal: Like a lifeless zombie
01/08/2017, 03:28 - Dhaani: No really. I'd have a creepy smile and a box cutter
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Munjaal: 😇
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Munjaal: Perfect
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Munjaal: Put on a clown makeover
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Dhaani: Noooo
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Dhaani: No need
01/08/2017, 03:29 - Munjaal: 😂😂
01/08/2017, 03:31 - Dhaani: Munjaal, thanks
01/08/2017, 03:31 - Munjaal: For ? 😕
01/08/2017, 03:32 - Dhaani: Being such a good friend
01/08/2017, 03:34 - Munjaal: 😂 you don't need to thank a friend for being one.
You are one of ,if not the most amazing person I've met so far (first position is kinda tied 😛 and shared)
01/08/2017, 03:36 - Munjaal: I mean. You're at the first position along with Anushri
01/08/2017, 03:36 - Dhaani: I am not that amazing.
01/08/2017, 03:37 - Munjaal: Perhaps. But I still haven't found anyone that tops you yet and I've lived quite long I think
01/08/2017, 03:38 - Dhaani: I don't understand
01/08/2017, 03:38 - Dhaani: I understand finding Anushri amazing.
01/08/2017, 03:38 - Dhaani: She is strong willed, smart, sweet, funny, pretty, kind, tough
01/08/2017, 03:38 - Dhaani: She is a real combination
01/08/2017, 03:39 - Munjaal: All of those for you perfectly as well.
01/08/2017, 03:39 - Dhaani: She is also talented.
01/08/2017, 03:39 - Munjaal: Just write down all the events in your life , past and present. You'll know yourself
01/08/2017, 03:40 - Dhaani: Not to that extent na
01/08/2017, 03:40 - Munjaal: I can list down a lot of things she looks up to you for.
01/08/2017, 03:40 - Munjaal: And that will be true in the other direction as well
01/08/2017, 03:40 - Munjaal: Thus the tie
01/08/2017, 03:40 - Dhaani: Really?
01/08/2017, 03:41 - Munjaal: Yeah I can.
01/08/2017, 03:43 - Dhaani: That's surprising
01/08/2017, 03:43 - Munjaal: 🙂 it thought it was obvious
01/08/2017, 03:43 - Munjaal: *I
01/08/2017, 03:44 - Dhaani: I don't know
01/08/2017, 03:44 - Dhaani: Having an off night, remember?
01/08/2017, 03:44 - Munjaal: By no means do I say you both are perfect. But it is the imperfections that draw in a curious eye after all.
01/08/2017, 03:45 - Dhaani: Fair enough
01/08/2017, 03:45 - Dhaani: Tell me my imperfections?
01/08/2017, 03:46 - Munjaal: I'll have to think a little hard to dig em up
01/08/2017, 03:47 - Dhaani: Oh come on
01/08/2017, 03:48 - Munjaal: Sometimes you take a lot of stress
01/08/2017, 03:48 - Munjaal: It reflects on your health quite visibly
01/08/2017, 03:49 - Dhaani: Visibly?
01/08/2017, 03:49 - Munjaal: Heart Rate, Exhaustion
01/08/2017, 03:50 - Munjaal: Drops in overall wellness
01/08/2017, 03:50 - Dhaani: Exhaustion, not so much. Heart rate rare days now.
01/08/2017, 03:50 - Dhaani: I try to avoid stress. But some situations can't be avoided
01/08/2017, 03:51 - Munjaal: Agreed. Just went em out. Any friend, Manish.
01/08/2017, 03:51 - Munjaal: It helps
01/08/2017, 03:52 - Dhaani: Manish is too busy
01/08/2017, 03:52 - Munjaal: I can handle a few punches too. 😼
01/08/2017, 03:52 - Dhaani: Most friends I'd normally speak to about these things aren't currently available
01/08/2017, 03:53 - Munjaal: I'm gifting you a punching bag
01/08/2017, 03:53 - Dhaani: Ehh, how is my previous gift doing?
01/08/2017, 03:54 - Munjaal: Sitting idly on my desk
01/08/2017, 03:54 - Dhaani: Send me a photo?
01/08/2017, 03:54 - Munjaal: Nope 😑, I'll give it to you directly now
01/08/2017, 03:55 - Munjaal: Not giving you the satisfaction of looking at it before that
01/08/2017, 04:01 - Dhaani: Alright
01/08/2017, 07:48 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 07:49 - Dhaani: Quite a few
01/08/2017, 07:49 - Munjaal: 😂 like random people dying gruesome deaths ?
01/08/2017, 07:50 - Dhaani: Among others
01/08/2017, 07:50 - Munjaal: Hmm
01/08/2017, 07:55 - Dhaani: So I've slept for about 20-25 minutes
01/08/2017, 07:56 - Munjaal: That doesn't sound good at all
01/08/2017, 07:57 - Dhaani: Meh
01/08/2017, 07:57 - Munjaal: 😑
01/08/2017, 07:57 - Dhaani: I don't do this regularly. But I really just couldn't sleep.
01/08/2017, 07:58 - Munjaal: You're gonna feel tired the whole day now
01/08/2017, 07:58 - Dhaani: I guess
01/08/2017, 07:58 - Dhaani: I am so glad you can't tell Manish.
01/08/2017, 07:58 - Munjaal: 😪
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Munjaal: I can tell Anushri to tell him
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Dhaani: 😁
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Dhaani: Nooooo
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Dhaani: 🙈
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Munjaal: 😂😂
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Dhaani: He'll scold me.
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Munjaal: Hahahaha. That'll be a sight to see
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Munjaal: If I could
01/08/2017, 07:59 - Munjaal: 😞
01/08/2017, 08:00 - Dhaani: You want someone to scold me?
01/08/2017, 08:00 - Munjaal: Well I haven't even heard of something like that happen
01/08/2017, 08:00 - Munjaal: Something new 😋
01/08/2017, 08:00 - Munjaal: It's usually you scolding one of us
01/08/2017, 08:01 - Dhaani: I know!
01/08/2017, 08:01 - Dhaani: And it Shou stay that way
01/08/2017, 08:01 - Dhaani: *should
01/08/2017, 08:01 - Munjaal: 😂😂😂😂
01/08/2017, 08:01 - Munjaal: Sure sure
01/08/2017, 08:02 - Dhaani: You're going to tell Anushri, aren't you? 😒
01/08/2017, 08:02 - Munjaal: Well. I could overlook this for a bribe 😈
01/08/2017, 08:02 - Dhaani: Hahaha
01/08/2017, 12:45 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 12:48 - Munjaal: 😐
01/08/2017, 12:50 - Dhaani: It's ok. I'll check again in a few minutes
01/08/2017, 12:59 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 14:06 - Munjaal: 9
01/08/2017, 14:07 - Munjaal: Ka difference
01/08/2017, 14:21 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 14:22 - Dhaani: Oops
01/08/2017, 14:22 - Munjaal: 😐😐😐
01/08/2017, 14:22 - Munjaal: Where are you ?
01/08/2017, 14:23 - Dhaani: Vikhroli
01/08/2017, 14:29 - Munjaal: Don't die 😐
01/08/2017, 14:37 - Dhaani: I won't die
01/08/2017, 14:38 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 14:39 - Munjaal: Hmm
01/08/2017, 14:44 - Dhaani: What?
01/08/2017, 14:46 - Munjaal: Keep me updated
01/08/2017, 14:46 - Dhaani: I am na
01/08/2017, 14:46 - Munjaal: and take meds if any
01/08/2017, 14:46 - Munjaal: and don't take diet coke
01/08/2017, 14:53 - Dhaani: Not having diet coke. Just had chai
01/08/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: Okay
01/08/2017, 14:56 - Munjaal: Good
01/08/2017, 15:29 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
01/08/2017, 15:51 - Munjaal: 🙂
01/08/2017, 15:51 - Munjaal: Good
01/08/2017, 15:52 - Dhaani: See? No need to worry about me. 😋
01/08/2017, 15:52 - Dhaani: I just malfunction
01/08/2017, 15:52 - Munjaal: Yeah
01/08/2017, 15:52 - Munjaal: Unpredictably
01/08/2017, 15:52 - Dhaani: Yup
01/08/2017, 20:14 - Munjaal: Robocon

01/08/2017, 20:15 - Munjaal: My sem is gonna be packed
01/08/2017, 20:15 - Dhaani: This. This is why I told you to avoid enactus.
01/08/2017, 20:15 - Munjaal: 😅😅
01/08/2017, 20:16 - Dhaani: I give good advice. You should take it sometimes.
01/08/2017, 20:17 - Munjaal: 😛
01/08/2017, 20:18 - Dhaani: 😁
02/08/2017, 20:45 - Dhaani: I need a huge favour
02/08/2017, 20:45 - Munjaal: Yup
02/08/2017, 20:45 - Munjaal: Wassup ?
02/08/2017, 20:46 - Dhaani: They delivered the gift to my house instead of someone else's
02/08/2017, 20:46 - Munjaal: Wow lol
02/08/2017, 20:47 - Dhaani: Do you have any friend who will agree to pretend to be from Amazon and collect it from my house?
02/08/2017, 20:47 - Dhaani: I'll treat the person
02/08/2017, 20:47 - Munjaal: What did you tell your parents ?
02/08/2017, 20:47 - Munjaal: Misdelivered ?
02/08/2017, 20:48 - Dhaani: Yup
02/08/2017, 20:48 - Munjaal: 😑 you could've said that I wanted to gift it to say 'my gf' and thus I asked you to order it at your place
02/08/2017, 20:49 - Dhaani: I don't want to give them ammunition on my friends
02/08/2017, 20:49 - Munjaal: You can tell them still. That I informed you late that I had used your address
02/08/2017, 20:50 - Munjaal: Can I call you ?
02/08/2017, 20:50 - Dhaani: Nahi. Chat?
02/08/2017, 20:50 - Munjaal: Hmm
02/08/2017, 20:50 - Munjaal: Tell them that I was supposed to order it at your place, then changed my mind but forgot to cancel the order
02/08/2017, 20:51 - Munjaal: Just a suggestion
02/08/2017, 20:51 - Dhaani: Can I say it's a gift for your dad instead? 😅
02/08/2017, 20:51 - Munjaal: Anything
02/08/2017, 20:51 - Munjaal: As long as it works
02/08/2017, 20:51 - Munjaal: Dad makes more sense. I wouldn't want it getting delivered to him if it's a gift for him lol
02/08/2017, 20:52 - Dhaani: Exactly
02/08/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: If you say that then you could say you're taking it to give it to me
02/08/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: And deliver it to Manish
02/08/2017, 20:53 - Munjaal: Or come with me for the laser
02/08/2017, 20:54 - Dhaani: Ya, will do that.
03/08/2017, 09:39 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
03/08/2017, 09:39 - Munjaal: Made this yesterday
03/08/2017, 09:47 - Dhaani: I'll check later
04/08/2017, 13:24 - Dhaani: That's a partition in my lab
04/08/2017, 13:24 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
04/08/2017, 13:25 - Munjaal: wow
04/08/2017, 13:25 - Dhaani: Thought you'd find it interesting 😋
04/08/2017, 13:26 - Munjaal: That's a lazy engineers method of making a partition
04/08/2017, 13:26 - Dhaani: You know, this could look quite cool if dusted regularly
04/08/2017, 13:26 - Munjaal: "*if*"
04/08/2017, 13:26 - Dhaani: Don't you agree?
04/08/2017, 13:27 - Munjaal: Yeah. And arranged a little more properly
04/08/2017, 13:27 - Dhaani: Or just replace the torn carton with more old CPUs
04/08/2017, 13:51 - Munjaal: Hmm
04/08/2017, 13:51 - Munjaal: Works
04/08/2017, 13:51 - Munjaal: Even the files
04/08/2017, 13:57 - Dhaani: Files are fine. They bring some colour
05/08/2017, 09:43 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
05/08/2017, 09:55 - Dhaani: ?
05/08/2017, 09:55 - Munjaal: Nothing lol
05/08/2017, 09:56 - Munjaal: Random meme
05/08/2017, 09:57 - Munjaal: When do you want to get it engraved ? The chess set
05/08/2017, 10:04 - Dhaani: Not getting it engraved
05/08/2017, 10:10 - Munjaal: Why suddenly not engraving ?
05/08/2017, 10:33 - Dhaani: I'll tell you later.
05/08/2017, 10:41 - Munjaal: Okay
05/08/2017, 23:57 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
05/08/2017, 23:57 - Munjaal: 😁
05/08/2017, 23:57 - Dhaani: 😒
05/08/2017, 23:58 - Munjaal: Is it a good time now ?
05/08/2017, 23:58 - Dhaani: Well, two reasons
05/08/2017, 23:59 - Munjaal: One you're in Pune ?
05/08/2017, 23:59 - Dhaani: Did I mention that he might be leaving Mumbai soon?
05/08/2017, 23:59 - Dhaani: And we haven't decided what happens about us when he leaves
05/08/2017, 23:59 - Munjaal: I don't like where this is going but go on
05/08/2017, 23:59 - Dhaani: So I didn't want the gift to be about us.
06/08/2017, 00:00 - Munjaal: 🙁
06/08/2017, 00:00 - Dhaani: Because I wanted the gift to be something that's about him, his interests. So that, even if he moves on, he can keep it.
06/08/2017, 00:00 - Dhaani: And it can continue to hold value without being uncomfortable.
06/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: But..
06/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: Well..
06/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: I dunno
06/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: Isn't it a long shot to just assume the negative ?
06/08/2017, 00:01 - Dhaani: Not assuming the negative.
06/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: The other reason is, after receiving it, I looked at the set. It is too small to have something etched into it.
06/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: As in, it's possible to etch but it'll draw too much attention.
06/08/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: Hmm
06/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: The proportion will be off.
06/08/2017, 00:03 - Munjaal: The laser can work on a minimum dimension of 0.1mm
06/08/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: Haan but it'll either be too small or it'll be too prominent.
06/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: Hmm. Maybe
06/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: Send me a pic if you can ?
06/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: In your hand for scale if can
06/08/2017, 00:04 - Dhaani: And I want any words to be between us. A chess set will be used by him and another person.
06/08/2017, 00:05 - Munjaal: Hmm alright
06/08/2017, 17:17 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
06/08/2017, 17:21 - Dhaani: 😃
06/08/2017, 17:53 - Munjaal: 😁
06/08/2017, 17:53 - Dhaani: I want!
06/08/2017, 17:53 - Munjaal: Hehehe
06/08/2017, 17:54 - Munjaal: You're too busy
06/08/2017, 17:54 - Dhaani: Noooo
06/08/2017, 17:54 - Dhaani: Is mine. I want!
06/08/2017, 17:54 - Munjaal: 😂
06/08/2017, 17:54 - Munjaal: Make time. Me gets
06/08/2017, 17:55 - Dhaani: Theek hai
06/08/2017, 21:43 - Munjaal: That's v2.0 by the way
06/08/2017, 21:43 - Dhaani: As in?
06/08/2017, 21:43 - Munjaal: Well 😅
06/08/2017, 21:43 - Dhaani: Tell me.
06/08/2017, 21:44 - Munjaal: The original one kinda broke
06/08/2017, 21:44 - Munjaal: So me makes again
06/08/2017, 21:45 - Dhaani: Why?
06/08/2017, 21:45 - Munjaal: And me can't show what don't exist so...
06/08/2017, 21:45 - Dhaani: Too much effort na
06/08/2017, 21:45 - Munjaal: Nope. My mistake it broke.
06/08/2017, 21:47 - Munjaal: And do you really think I would find making a Terrarium difficult ? 😑
06/08/2017, 21:48 - Munjaal: Hey listen. Can I ask you for a favour please ?
06/08/2017, 21:48 - Dhaani: Sure.
06/08/2017, 21:48 - Munjaal: Can you try and cheer Anushri up a little over text ?
06/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: I know you're busy but I'm not too good with stuff like that
06/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: And don't text her right away. She'll know I spoke to you.
06/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: Please ?
06/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: If you like, have some time later
06/08/2017, 21:50 - Munjaal: I feel kinda guilty for asking you
06/08/2017, 21:50 - Dhaani: Sure.
06/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: Thank you :')
06/08/2017, 21:51 - Dhaani: Ehh, I care about her too. It isn't really a favour.
06/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: No
06/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: You had no way of figuring out right ?
06/08/2017, 21:51 - Dhaani: So?
06/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: and I too should be able to do something like that right ?
06/08/2017, 21:52 - Dhaani: Not always.
06/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: True you care about her but don't I need to learn how to cheer my friends up too ?
06/08/2017, 21:53 - Munjaal: I'm essentially relying on you right now cause I'm incapable.
06/08/2017, 21:53 - Dhaani: Each friend is in a different position. Sometimes, you're just not in the right position to cheer someone up. And that's ok.
06/08/2017, 21:53 - Munjaal: Perhaps
06/08/2017, 21:54 - Dhaani: Some faith in me would be nice. 😋
06/08/2017, 21:54 - Dhaani: Put yourself in her place.
06/08/2017, 21:54 - Munjaal: Oh I have faith in you.  It's me I like it in
06/08/2017, 21:54 - Munjaal: *lack it
06/08/2017, 21:55 - Dhaani: Aren't there times when you're low and there are some friends who, despite trying, can't really reach because you may not feel like they can relate because of their circumstances in life?
06/08/2017, 21:55 - Munjaal: Yeah
06/08/2017, 21:55 - Dhaani: Does that make them bad friends?
06/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: But then would I try to talk to them about an issue in the first place ? An important issue if I knew they wouldn't be able to connect ?
06/08/2017, 21:56 - Dhaani: If you're feeling particularly lost, maybe.
06/08/2017, 21:56 - Dhaani: If you've been trying to hard to keep it to yourself and they happen to be around just when you can't anymore, maybe.
06/08/2017, 21:57 - Munjaal: I guess that sums up the situation. I can't speak of details
06/08/2017, 21:58 - Dhaani: I know you can't.
06/08/2017, 21:59 - Munjaal: Just let me know when you message her. I'll prefer going offline
06/08/2017, 22:00 - Dhaani: I'll message later. Give thoda gap.
06/08/2017, 22:00 - Munjaal: Yeah but let me know
06/08/2017, 22:02 - Dhaani: Ofcourse
07/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: Couldn't text her tonight
07/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: Mum's a little hyper.
07/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: I'll get in touch with her tomorrow
07/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: Do you have college tomorrow?
07/08/2017, 00:34 - Munjaal: Yeah we got college tomorrow
07/08/2017, 00:34 - Dhaani: Sorry
07/08/2017, 00:35 - Munjaal: Gimme a shot at talking to her personally. I'm good at that , just can't over text
07/08/2017, 00:35 - Munjaal: Really 😑 ?
07/08/2017, 00:35 - Dhaani: Yes.
07/08/2017, 00:35 - Munjaal: Time for you to show faith in me I guess
07/08/2017, 00:36 - Munjaal: Take care of your mum. I'm still here
07/08/2017, 00:39 - Dhaani: I have faith
07/08/2017, 07:31 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/08/2017, 08:42 - Dhaani: ?
07/08/2017, 10:41 - Munjaal: I can totally imagine you hopping around in the rain with this song
07/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: Dhaani
07/08/2017, 21:54 - Dhaani: Bolo
07/08/2017, 21:55 - Munjaal: This isn't something I'll be a able to go through unscathed. And I can't share a word either.
07/08/2017, 21:56 - Dhaani: What?
07/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Don't worry too much
07/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: You'll just have to be a field medic of sorts perhaps.
07/08/2017, 22:04 - Munjaal: Maybe I shouldn't have said shutting
07/08/2017, 22:04 - Munjaal: *anything
07/08/2017, 22:09 - Dhaani: 😐
07/08/2017, 22:09 - Munjaal: 😁 👆🏻👍🏻
07/08/2017, 22:10 - Dhaani: I have no idea what's going on.
07/08/2017, 22:10 - Dhaani: But I'll have to catch up with her soon
07/08/2017, 22:10 - Munjaal: You can't
07/08/2017, 22:10 - Dhaani: I can't?:
07/08/2017, 22:10 - Dhaani: Is she alright, healthwise?
07/08/2017, 22:11 - Munjaal: You can but I'm almost sure you won't understand or foresee anything
07/08/2017, 22:11 - Dhaani: I have no idea what's going on. Just worried
07/08/2017, 22:11 - Munjaal: I'm sorry. I know it's a little naive for me to get you worried knowing I can't really tell you anything
07/08/2017, 22:12 - Dhaani: It's ok
07/08/2017, 22:12 - Munjaal: I'm just..
07/08/2017, 22:12 - Dhaani: Freaking out and in over your head?
07/08/2017, 22:12 - Munjaal: I feel helpless ... Completely helpless
07/08/2017, 22:12 - Munjaal: Yet I can't ask for help
07/08/2017, 22:13 - Dhaani: Ohkay
07/08/2017, 22:14 - Munjaal: Im just lost
07/08/2017, 22:16 - Munjaal: Tell me one thing ?
07/08/2017, 22:16 - Dhaani: Ask
07/08/2017, 22:16 - Munjaal: If you were bothered by something. Something that mattered a lot to you
07/08/2017, 22:17 - Munjaal: And the end result you ended up losing faith in yourself and the concept of friendship
07/08/2017, 22:18 - Munjaal: Would it be okay for me to remind you how much you matter to me ?
07/08/2017, 22:18 - Munjaal: In a direct way by confrontation ?
07/08/2017, 22:18 - Munjaal: Or would it be preferred to do so by my actions
07/08/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: Say I gift you something
07/08/2017, 22:19 - Dhaani: Both
07/08/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: Could I just give you a hug and tell you to not be stupid ?
07/08/2017, 22:20 - Munjaal: Or should I maintain the unfathomed barrier of distance ?
07/08/2017, 22:20 - Dhaani: That probably wouldn't work. Too soft.
07/08/2017, 22:21 - Munjaal: What should I do to tell you I really really value you
07/08/2017, 22:22 - Dhaani: I don't know
07/08/2017, 22:22 - Dhaani: I don't know the nuances of the situation
07/08/2017, 22:22 - Munjaal: You just feel like there is no one you can trust anymore
07/08/2017, 22:22 - Munjaal: That you should be mechanical
07/08/2017, 22:23 - Munjaal: That opening up only means hurting yourself indirectly
07/08/2017, 22:23 - Dhaani: 😐
07/08/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: I wasn't supposed to go even this far. I can't mention details
07/08/2017, 22:25 - Dhaani: I know
07/08/2017, 22:25 - Dhaani: Nevermind
07/08/2017, 22:25 - Munjaal: I'm sorry.
07/08/2017, 22:26 - Dhaani: It's ok
07/08/2017, 22:26 - Munjaal: Ignore everything. I'll do something
07/08/2017, 22:29 - Dhaani: I know you will
07/08/2017, 23:55 - Munjaal: You know. I'll never know how to thank you enough for being the friend you are.
08/08/2017, 09:51 - Dhaani: Arre
08/08/2017, 09:51 - Dhaani: I don't know how to react to that
08/08/2017, 09:52 - Munjaal: You don't have to 😛🙂
08/08/2017, 09:53 - Dhaani: You know I feel the same way, right?
08/08/2017, 09:54 - Munjaal: 😁
08/08/2017, 09:54 - Dhaani: I don't want to go to work today. 🙈
08/08/2017, 09:54 - Munjaal: 😂😂
08/08/2017, 09:55 - Munjaal: Bored
08/08/2017, 09:55 - Munjaal: ?
08/08/2017, 09:56 - Dhaani: Yes
08/08/2017, 09:56 - Dhaani: And tired.
08/08/2017, 09:56 - Munjaal: Will it reflect badly if you take the day off ?
08/08/2017, 09:57 - Dhaani: Not really
08/08/2017, 09:57 - Munjaal: Then what's the issue 😑
08/08/2017, 09:59 - Dhaani: That I don't really have anything to do if I don't go today
08/08/2017, 09:59 - Dhaani: And no reason to give for not going to work.
08/08/2017, 13:08 - Dhaani: Look at time stamps. 😓
08/08/2017, 13:08 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 13:08 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 13:12 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 13:22 - Munjaal: 😕
08/08/2017, 13:23 - Dhaani: I don't know yaa
08/08/2017, 13:23 - Munjaal: It is stable na now ?
08/08/2017, 13:23 - Dhaani: It came down to 87 na
08/08/2017, 13:23 - Dhaani: I'll check again in a while
08/08/2017, 13:23 - Munjaal: 87 is good
08/08/2017, 13:24 - Dhaani: Yes. It is
08/08/2017, 13:24 - Dhaani: I feel cold
08/08/2017, 13:24 - Munjaal: Are you sweating as well ?
08/08/2017, 13:24 - Dhaani: Thoda. Why?
08/08/2017, 13:24 - Munjaal: Your blood pressure has dropped
08/08/2017, 13:25 - Munjaal: Take any sodium intake for now
08/08/2017, 13:26 - Dhaani: I will
08/08/2017, 13:27 - Munjaal: If you start feeling more cold and tired and if the sweating increases just go to some place you can sit. Rest for a while. Book a cab and go home
08/08/2017, 13:27 - Munjaal: In case you can't go home I can keep you company.
08/08/2017, 13:28 - Dhaani: I am at work. Sitting in one place anyway
08/08/2017, 13:51 - Munjaal: Hmm
08/08/2017, 13:51 - Munjaal: Take care
08/08/2017, 15:25 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 15:27 - Munjaal: Not too high. Good
08/08/2017, 15:27 - Dhaani: Feeling cold
08/08/2017, 15:27 - Dhaani: Not sweating but really cold
08/08/2017, 15:34 - Munjaal: Body ache ?
08/08/2017, 15:34 - Munjaal: And weakness ?
08/08/2017, 15:34 - Dhaani: Yes
08/08/2017, 15:35 - Munjaal: Feeling this way only today ?
08/08/2017, 15:35 - Dhaani: Bodyache started last night
08/08/2017, 15:35 - Munjaal: Feverish ?
08/08/2017, 15:36 - Dhaani: Don't know
08/08/2017, 15:37 - Munjaal: Seems like a viral. It has the same symptoms
08/08/2017, 15:37 - Dhaani: 🙈
08/08/2017, 16:06 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 16:15 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/08/2017, 16:22 - Munjaal: Please be careful
08/08/2017, 16:23 - Munjaal: 😕
08/08/2017, 16:23 - Dhaani: I am!
08/08/2017, 23:32 - Dhaani: Sorry I didn't call you back
08/08/2017, 23:42 - Munjaal: It's okay
08/08/2017, 23:44 - Dhaani: It was a sensitive situation
08/08/2017, 23:44 - Munjaal: It's alright. I had just randomly called up
08/08/2017, 23:44 - Dhaani: Aah. Ok
08/08/2017, 23:46 - Munjaal: How are you feeling now ?
08/08/2017, 23:47 - Dhaani: Better noe
08/08/2017, 23:47 - Dhaani: *now
08/08/2017, 23:48 - Munjaal: Hmm
08/08/2017, 23:48 - Dhaani: Had been feverish earlier.
08/08/2017, 23:48 - Munjaal: Could be general weakness
08/08/2017, 23:49 - Dhaani: Could be
08/08/2017, 23:49 - Dhaani: Can you do me a huge favor?
08/08/2017, 23:49 - Munjaal: Yup
08/08/2017, 23:50 - Dhaani: Remind me of a Google sheet tomorrow during the day?
08/08/2017, 23:50 - Munjaal: Okay
08/08/2017, 23:50 - Munjaal: Around a specific time ?
08/08/2017, 23:51 - Dhaani: Nah
08/08/2017, 23:52 - Dhaani: Listen, I am sorry I got you worried today
08/08/2017, 23:52 - Munjaal: It's alright.
08/08/2017, 23:52 - Munjaal: I wasn't too worried cause you were at the office
08/08/2017, 23:54 - Dhaani: About that
08/08/2017, 23:54 - Dhaani: I left office at 4
09/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: 😑
09/08/2017, 00:01 - Dhaani: What?
09/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: And went straight home I assume
09/08/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: Or wandered about to enter at a no mm suspicious timing ?
09/08/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: *non
09/08/2017, 00:05 - Dhaani: Non suspicious
09/08/2017, 00:06 - Munjaal: ..
09/08/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: Whatm
09/08/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: *what?
09/08/2017, 22:05 - Munjaal: So
09/08/2017, 22:05 - Munjaal: I'm getting an offer to teach Arduino to 2nd , 3rd year electrical students
11/08/2017, 00:07 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
11/08/2017, 00:20 - Munjaal: 😂😂
11/08/2017, 00:20 - Munjaal: That suits me more
11/08/2017, 00:22 - Dhaani: Really?
11/08/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: 😜
11/08/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: By the way
11/08/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
11/08/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: So I saw a therapist today
11/08/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: You should start seeing one.
11/08/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: Like hell.
11/08/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: What did she/he tell ?
11/08/2017, 00:26 - Dhaani: ?
11/08/2017, 00:26 - Dhaani: Nothing. Today was the first session. I just gave her some background on my life.
11/08/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: I'm no good if I can't manage to find my own way out
11/08/2017, 00:28 - Dhaani: Yes, let's dig a tunnel with our nails even though we have shovels lying around.
11/08/2017, 00:29 - Munjaal: A therapist would require me to share my troubles right ?
11/08/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: Yes.
11/08/2017, 00:32 - Munjaal: Do you know Caffeine is a very good antidepressant and some people (including myself now) self medicate depression with it
11/08/2017, 00:32 - Munjaal: I found out about it after I started taking
11/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: You idiot!
11/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: Self medicating for depression is a horrible idea
11/08/2017, 00:33 - Dhaani: And you know that
11/08/2017, 00:34 - Dhaani: You'll have to work through it at some point.
11/08/2017, 00:35 - Munjaal: Yeah. 😪
11/08/2017, 00:35 - Munjaal: Although I hope it would just pass away as a phase
11/08/2017, 00:36 - Dhaani: I hope so too
11/08/2017, 00:36 - Dhaani: But if you work through your issues, you give it less of a chance to take root na.
11/08/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: True
11/08/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: Well
11/08/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: You've got work tomorrow ,m
11/08/2017, 00:38 - Munjaal: *?
11/08/2017, 00:40 - Dhaani: VJTI
11/08/2017, 00:40 - Munjaal: That's more depressing than life
11/08/2017, 00:40 - Munjaal: ma'am
11/08/2017, 00:42 - Dhaani: 🙈
11/08/2017, 00:42 - Dhaani: Though, to be honest, I might not go.
11/08/2017, 00:43 - Dhaani: Haven't been feeling well.
11/08/2017, 00:43 - Dhaani: Might go to a friend's place and sleep instead.
11/08/2017, 00:46 - Munjaal: Thank you
11/08/2017, 00:46 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
11/08/2017, 00:46 - Dhaani: I am trying to take care of myself na
11/08/2017, 00:47 - Dhaani: Why so frustrated at me?
11/08/2017, 00:47 - Munjaal: Not frustrated lol
11/08/2017, 00:47 - Munjaal: It's more of a "finally" feeling
11/08/2017, 00:48 - Dhaani: Why finally?
11/08/2017, 00:48 - Munjaal: Cause you you'd probably end up  "must go, my  college needs me"  mode with a high heart rate and low bp
11/08/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: So it's good you're resting
11/08/2017, 00:49 - Dhaani: Meh. No one needs me.
11/08/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: 😂
11/08/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: Your lab instructor probably does
11/08/2017, 00:49 - Munjaal: Screw him though
11/08/2017, 00:50 - Dhaani: Lab tomorrow is cancelled
11/08/2017, 00:50 - Munjaal: Ah great
11/08/2017, 00:51 - Dhaani: Sweet of the friend to offer his house though
11/08/2017, 00:51 - Munjaal: Yepp
11/08/2017, 00:51 - Dhaani: Me tired.
11/08/2017, 00:51 - Munjaal: Sleep
11/08/2017, 00:51 - Dhaani: I had high heart rate in the morning.
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: Then lost my voice for half the day.
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Munjaal: How much ?
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: And was feverish.
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Munjaal: 😑
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: Not too high. 120 while sitting
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Dhaani: And got dizzy for a bit.
11/08/2017, 00:52 - Munjaal: You're way too modest where you shouldn't be 😑
11/08/2017, 00:53 - Munjaal: 120 while sitting ? Mine stays 120 while exercising
11/08/2017, 00:53 - Dhaani: It's 62 now, if that makes you feel better.
11/08/2017, 00:53 - Munjaal: Well yeah but I'm more concerned about the spikes
11/08/2017, 00:53 - Dhaani: And it once touched 160. You know this. So, relatively, 120 isn't too high na.
11/08/2017, 00:54 - Munjaal: Yeah. 160 isn't good
11/08/2017, 00:56 - Dhaani: I know
11/08/2017, 01:03 - Munjaal: You're doing something ?
11/08/2017, 01:04 - Dhaani: Nahi. Just getting into the mood to sleep. Why?
11/08/2017, 01:05 - Munjaal: Aise hi
11/08/2017, 01:05 - Dhaani: Since it's a VJTI day, I have to leave home at 7:30 anyway. 😅
11/08/2017, 01:05 - Munjaal: lol
11/08/2017, 01:07 - Dhaani: Yup
11/08/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: I have college at 11
11/08/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: But I'm gonna leave by 7 or 8
11/08/2017, 01:07 - Dhaani: Why?
11/08/2017, 01:08 - Munjaal: Two reasons 
1 less rush early morning
11/08/2017, 01:08 - Munjaal: 2 , if I stay home not doing anything, I feel more depressed
11/08/2017, 01:12 - Dhaani: Fair enough
11/08/2017, 01:15 - Munjaal: I guess I'll try to sleep as well
11/08/2017, 01:15 - Munjaal: Goodnight
11/08/2017, 06:06 - Munjaal: Life these days.
Set an alarm for 6am
11/08/2017, 06:07 - Munjaal: Woke up on my own at 5:59
11/08/2017, 07:11 - Dhaani: Huh
11/08/2017, 07:20 - Munjaal: Nothing nothing
11/08/2017, 07:42 - Dhaani: I hate when that happens
11/08/2017, 07:42 - Dhaani: That last minute of sleep suddenly starts feeling precious.
11/08/2017, 07:42 - Munjaal: XD
11/08/2017, 07:43 - Munjaal: I just feel happy cause it feels like a natural alarm
11/08/2017, 20:17 - Munjaal: Hey
11/08/2017, 20:17 - Munjaal: I'll get the terrarium tomorrow right ?
11/08/2017, 21:19 - Dhaani: Sorry, I couldn't talk properly
11/08/2017, 21:30 - Munjaal: It's alright. We'll talk tomorrow aaram se
11/08/2017, 21:32 - Dhaani: I am a little worried about you
11/08/2017, 21:35 - Munjaal: I might be a little low but I assure you I'm the last person that will do anything stupid
11/08/2017, 21:36 - Munjaal: * ~little~
11/08/2017, 21:36 - Dhaani: Not worried about you doing anything stupid.
11/08/2017, 21:37 - Munjaal: What's bothering you then ma'am ?
11/08/2017, 21:37 - Munjaal: I'm just a harmless little kid 💁🏻‍♂
11/08/2017, 21:37 - Dhaani: Worried about you not taking care of yourself
11/08/2017, 21:38 - Munjaal: I've been actively doing damage control wherever possible
11/08/2017, 21:38 - Munjaal: Although inefficiently
11/08/2017, 21:38 - Dhaani: That's what I am worried about
11/08/2017, 21:39 - Munjaal: 😅
11/08/2017, 21:39 - Dhaani: And you're avoiding a lot of the obvious solutions.
11/08/2017, 21:39 - Munjaal: Yeah.
11/08/2017, 21:40 - Munjaal: I'd have to break a few personal rules to be able to resort to obvious solutions. Can't afford that
11/08/2017, 21:40 - Dhaani: Which rules?
11/08/2017, 21:41 - Munjaal: One of the most important being I absolutely cannot share a thing about what's bothering me
11/08/2017, 21:41 - Dhaani: 😒
11/08/2017, 21:42 - Munjaal: It's not a silly moral or anything.
11/08/2017, 21:42 - Dhaani: Then?
11/08/2017, 21:42 - Munjaal: I simply do not have the right to decide to share it
11/08/2017, 21:43 - Dhaani: Why is that?
11/08/2017, 21:45 - Munjaal: That is just one. I have my train-wreck of a CGPA to improve
11/08/2017, 21:45 - Munjaal: 2.64 and it's gonna go down a little more when my 2nd year results come out
11/08/2017, 21:46 - Munjaal: Having to deal with 2 people in a group of 5 who don't give ANY FUCKING INPUT and don't respect me working my ass out to make sure our committee doesn't go down the drain
11/08/2017, 21:48 - Munjaal: A project that I'll be doing on my own as no one in my batch is capable of helping or joining in skillwise
11/08/2017, 21:49 - Dhaani: Alright
11/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: I'm sorry I kinda let out a little of my frustration
11/08/2017, 21:49 - Munjaal: But it really bothers me
11/08/2017, 21:49 - Dhaani: This, I take is someone else's story to share.
11/08/2017, 21:49 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: So a simple task of suggesting a name for the committee takes them forever.  I told them we're in a hurry and I need to push this through as soon as possible and it's 30+ Hours.
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: Still waiting for them to reply
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Dhaani: 😐
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: You know something
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Dhaani: Tell me
11/08/2017, 21:51 - Munjaal: I'd rather just work with Shaurya and Anushri alone
11/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: Than having to beg them to help me help them
11/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: But it's not something I can say anymore
11/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: Given my circumstances
11/08/2017, 21:52 - Dhaani: Which other two people are there? Who isn't working?
11/08/2017, 21:52 - Munjaal: Panda , Aniruddh
11/08/2017, 21:53 - Munjaal: Perhaps I'm overreacting. Maybe I shouldn't care
11/08/2017, 21:54 - Dhaani: It's you. You will care.
11/08/2017, 21:54 - Dhaani: Suggest two bad names. Choose one of them. They'll start coming up with suggestions in no time.
11/08/2017, 21:54 - Munjaal: Already did
11/08/2017, 21:54 - Munjaal: That's how I started off in fact
11/08/2017, 21:54 - Munjaal: I even created a Google forms
11/08/2017, 21:55 - Munjaal: Posted the link
11/08/2017, 21:55 - Munjaal: So that anyone can vote and/or submit their own name
11/08/2017, 21:55 - Dhaani: 😐
11/08/2017, 21:55 - Munjaal: Been checking it almost every 2 hours
11/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Went to college 2 hours early just to make sure I could meet the mentor incharge and show her our seriousness
11/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Haven't been late regarding any information requirement by them
11/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Have missed lectures to make sure the proposal was ready
11/08/2017, 21:57 - Munjaal: Have been working on my past designs to make them display worthy for the Dean.
11/08/2017, 21:59 - Munjaal: Have stayed back and talked to 3 different faculties to arrange a single meeting for which I wanted their help to decide a time. And still they didn't care to reply in time
11/08/2017, 22:04 - Dhaani: Tell them that they don't have to be part of this if they're not interested.
11/08/2017, 22:28 - Munjaal: Or I can essentially show them down by unanimously deciding everything
11/08/2017, 22:29 - Dhaani: You could
11/08/2017, 22:29 - Munjaal: I will make sure to inform Shaurya ~and Anushri~
11/08/2017, 22:29 - Dhaani: Why did you cross out Anushri?
11/08/2017, 22:29 - Dhaani: She is too close to them?
11/08/2017, 22:29 - Munjaal: To one of them
11/08/2017, 22:30 - Munjaal: I can't say close or not but definitely friends with
11/08/2017, 22:40 - Dhaani: Fair enough
11/08/2017, 22:42 - Munjaal: Tell me frankly. Am I doing more than I'm supposed to ?
11/08/2017, 22:42 - Dhaani: Yes.
11/08/2017, 22:43 - Munjaal: But doesn't the situation demand so ? We're on an all out war of sorts
11/08/2017, 22:43 - Munjaal: Something that can very possibly go up the management
11/08/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: Sure. With this team.
11/08/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: What about the other things you have on your plate!
11/08/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: *?
11/08/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: Victor tango, I understand is your team.
11/08/2017, 22:47 - Dhaani: And that project is something you want to work on.
11/08/2017, 22:47 - Dhaani: But enactus?
11/08/2017, 22:47 - Dhaani: And what else are you up to?
11/08/2017, 22:47 - Dhaani: You need to understand that you can't be fair to so many things and yourself. You'll end up compromising somewhere.
11/08/2017, 22:48 - Munjaal: I'm already shedding off the weight
11/08/2017, 22:48 - Munjaal: Started with giving away the 2 seminars
11/08/2017, 22:48 - Dhaani: If it's quality of work, it'll be personal life. It'll be time and attitude towards family. And health. And grades.
11/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: I know. I noticed and I am glad.
11/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: But you keep trying to find a short cut for the rest.
11/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: Pills for alertness and dedication.
11/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: Crazy diet for health.
11/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: You need to understand, short cuts do compromise somewhere. It's always a trade off.
11/08/2017, 22:50 - Munjaal: 😞 when reality hits hard
11/08/2017, 22:50 - Dhaani: And what you're putting your body through will affect your ability to work eventually. We both know that.
11/08/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: Yeah. Cancelled tonight's overnight work as well. Will do it tomorrow in college
11/08/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Good
11/08/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Don't forget, insaan ho.
11/08/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: 😅
11/08/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: All of this was a desperate attempt to fill a void I felt.
11/08/2017, 22:53 - Dhaani: That's obvious. You know you can talk about it if you want to.
11/08/2017, 22:54 - Munjaal: I will. But I feel guilty whenever I do
11/08/2017, 22:54 - Munjaal: You have so many things to deal with I really feel bad that I have to add even 1%
11/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: I worry more not knowing what's wrong. You know that. So don't use that excuse.
11/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: And I will worry.
11/08/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: Thus I try to hide. But fail 😅
11/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: At this point, mera hak banta hai, to worry. 😋
11/08/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: Okey ma'am 🙇🏻
11/08/2017, 22:56 - Dhaani: Also, sharing what's bothering you with me will never be a burden. It's a display of trust that I will always appreciate.
11/08/2017, 22:57 - Munjaal: 🙂 point noted
11/08/2017, 22:58 - Munjaal: P.S: it holds the other way around as well. Just a reminder
11/08/2017, 22:59 - Dhaani: I've started na.
11/08/2017, 22:59 - Munjaal: Aye aye
11/08/2017, 23:00 - Dhaani: You realize I am going to hope you'll talk about this tomorrow, right?
11/08/2017, 23:00 - Munjaal: Yeah
11/08/2017, 23:00 - Munjaal: I will
11/08/2017, 23:01 - Dhaani: ☺
11/08/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: 😁
11/08/2017, 23:06 - Dhaani: So I didn't go to VJTI today
11/08/2017, 23:06 - Munjaal: yay
11/08/2017, 23:06 - Munjaal: Rested at a friend's place as planned ?m
11/08/2017, 23:07 - Dhaani: Yup
11/08/2017, 23:07 - Dhaani: Slept for 5 hours
11/08/2017, 23:07 - Munjaal: 😯 nice nice
11/08/2017, 23:07 - Dhaani: I know! I needed it.
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Dhaani: It's made me feel so much better
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Munjaal: That's the first time you skipped. Gotta congratulate you 😂
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Dhaani: The friend was very sweet about it
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Dhaani: He made me tea and then left for work.
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Munjaal: *Tea* 😄😄
11/08/2017, 23:08 - Dhaani: After telling me there was cake, butter chicken and naan in the fridge
11/08/2017, 23:09 - Dhaani: And leaving a bottle of water on the table
11/08/2017, 23:09 - Dhaani: He even offered to leave his set of the house keys so that I would be more comfortable knowing he wouldn't come home while I was asleep.
11/08/2017, 23:10 - Munjaal: Wow.
11/08/2017, 23:10 - Munjaal: You know some really good people don't you ? 😜
11/08/2017, 23:10 - Dhaani: Though I refused that because I had to leave before he got home from work.
11/08/2017, 23:10 - Dhaani: I do! I keep telling you, I got really lucky with people in my life.
11/08/2017, 23:10 - Munjaal: 😂😂
11/08/2017, 23:11 - Munjaal: Lucky as well as unlucky
11/08/2017, 23:11 - Munjaal: The graph of quality of people in your life has a very high standard deviation
11/08/2017, 23:11 - Dhaani: He later offered to make me a key too his house so I could go there and rest whenever I want be he generally doesn't get home before 9 and someone should use his house.
11/08/2017, 23:11 - Dhaani: *to his house
11/08/2017, 23:12 - Dhaani: *because he generally
11/08/2017, 23:12 - Munjaal: That's ...
11/08/2017, 23:13 - Munjaal: Too nice for anyone I can think of lol
11/08/2017, 23:14 - Dhaani: Hai na?

13/08/2017, 17:32 - Dhaani: Baba, you know the first couple days will be difficult
13/08/2017, 17:32 - Munjaal: I'm not getting any headache because of an addiction
13/08/2017, 17:33 - Munjaal: Anti-depressants used to help
13/08/2017, 17:33 - Munjaal: Now it's the base mood
13/08/2017, 18:00 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
13/08/2017, 18:21 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
13/08/2017, 19:09 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>

14/08/2017, 10:54 - Dhaani: I know
14/08/2017, 11:09 - Munjaal: Are you planning to drop by ?
14/08/2017, 11:16 - Dhaani: Can't now.
14/08/2017, 11:16 - Dhaani: 😔
14/08/2017, 11:17 - Munjaal: That's alright

14/08/2017, 22:45 - Munjaal: Hmm
14/08/2017, 22:45 - Munjaal: Uneventful day I guess
14/08/2017, 22:45 - Munjaal: Trapped at home
14/08/2017, 22:49 - Dhaani: Trapped?
14/08/2017, 22:49 - Munjaal: Talking about you
14/08/2017, 22:50 - Dhaani: Nah
14/08/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Actually had a nice day
14/08/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: I think I am just thoda tired.
14/08/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: Heart Rate in check ?
14/08/2017, 22:52 - Dhaani: 79
14/08/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: Hmm. Pretty normal
14/08/2017, 22:53 - Dhaani: Yup.
14/08/2017, 22:53 - Dhaani: Baba, just normal tired.
14/08/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: Okay. 😅😛
14/08/2017, 22:54 - Munjaal: Catch some sleep I guess
14/08/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: I shall
14/08/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: Woke up late anyway
14/08/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: And apparently, I look super relaxed
14/08/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: I was told today that I am glowing 😝
14/08/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: "glowing" 😯
14/08/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: Curious
14/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: What?
14/08/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: I wonder how can that work as a compliment
14/08/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: Never heard that before anywhere
14/08/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: 💡
14/08/2017, 22:56 - Dhaani: It was followed my a statement about how nice my complexion is currently.
14/08/2017, 22:57 - Munjaal: okay . Quite literally then lol
14/08/2017, 22:57 - Dhaani: It was amusing
14/08/2017, 23:00 - Munjaal: 😂
14/08/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: It's fun to hear your incidents.
14/08/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: Always something new
14/08/2017, 23:03 - Dhaani: Arre
15/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: 😛
15/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: My life has gotten too boring yaa
15/08/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: It's difficult to believe you know
15/08/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: It's true
15/08/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: Nothing interesting happens!
15/08/2017, 00:03 - Munjaal: Don't your keep meeting new and interesting people ?
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Dhaani: Not anymore
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Dhaani: That's what I am saying na
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: Perhaps because you stopped going to interesting places ?
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Dhaani: True
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: College and work are both shitty places I think
15/08/2017, 00:04 - Dhaani: And some places stopped being interesting, like Prithvi
15/08/2017, 00:05 - Munjaal: Prithvi is full of Fafda Gathiya Gujjus most of the times now
15/08/2017, 00:06 - Munjaal: With dhokla expressions
15/08/2017, 00:06 - Dhaani: Uh huh
15/08/2017, 00:06 - Munjaal: It's become a Dibella V2.0
15/08/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: Yup.
15/08/2017, 00:08 - Dhaani: I need to find new spots.
15/08/2017, 00:09 - Munjaal: If it's a good one - it's hard to find
15/08/2017, 00:09 - Dhaani: I know. But I'll find some.
15/08/2017, 00:09 - Dhaani: I did find Aleph.
15/08/2017, 00:09 - Munjaal: Yeah
15/08/2017, 00:13 - Munjaal: I've decided on a name for the committee
15/08/2017, 00:13 - Munjaal: More like, Yudhajit and I together have
15/08/2017, 00:13 - Munjaal: The Nautilus
15/08/2017, 00:13 - Dhaani: Nice
15/08/2017, 00:14 - Munjaal: it's gonna be final. Changes, suggestions and criticism won't be entertained
15/08/2017, 00:14 - Munjaal: Heck I ain't even gonna inform them
15/08/2017, 00:16 - Dhaani: Ohkay
17/08/2017, 21:39 - Munjaal: Hello
17/08/2017, 21:56 - Dhaani: Hi
17/08/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: How've you been ?
17/08/2017, 22:02 - Dhaani: I am alright.
17/08/2017, 22:02 - Dhaani: You?
17/08/2017, 22:05 - Munjaal: Stopped the pills
17/08/2017, 22:05 - Munjaal: Not taking them again
17/08/2017, 22:11 - Dhaani: That's good to know
17/08/2017, 22:11 - Dhaani: But what prompted this?
17/08/2017, 22:11 - Munjaal: Half by myself
17/08/2017, 22:12 - Dhaani: And the other half?
17/08/2017, 22:12 - Munjaal: Everyone telling me it isn't a good idea
17/08/2017, 22:14 - Dhaani: I love everyone!
17/08/2017, 22:14 - Munjaal: 😂
17/08/2017, 22:14 - Munjaal: Everyone is essentially 2 people you know.
17/08/2017, 22:14 - Munjaal: One of em is you
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Dhaani: The other is Anushri?
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Dhaani: Or the classmate guy. I forgot his name.
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Munjaal: Yeah
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Dhaani: Aah
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Munjaal: You really think I listen to them
17/08/2017, 22:15 - Munjaal: ?
17/08/2017, 22:16 - Munjaal: 🙄
17/08/2017, 22:16 - Dhaani: No. But I think they still try to look out for you.
17/08/2017, 22:16 - Munjaal: Well. Yeah
17/08/2017, 22:19 - Dhaani: So don't write them off na
17/08/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: Not doing that.
17/08/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: I'm usually able to reverse convince them to make myself correct
17/08/2017, 22:20 - Munjaal: Doesn't work on you both 😞
17/08/2017, 22:20 - Dhaani: Hahahaha
17/08/2017, 22:20 - Munjaal: 😭
17/08/2017, 22:22 - Dhaani: 😬
17/08/2017, 22:22 - Munjaal: Nuff about the sad stuff
17/08/2017, 22:22 - Munjaal: How was your day ?
17/08/2017, 22:22 - Dhaani: It was good. Tiring though.
17/08/2017, 22:23 - Munjaal: Today was work day ? Or vjti day ?
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Dhaani: Work day.
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Dhaani: Had therapy before that.
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Dhaani: And my grandfather is here.
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: Tell me about the therapy
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Dhaani: And I had to go with mum for some work after getting back home.
17/08/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: If it's shareable
17/08/2017, 22:25 - Dhaani: Well, today I gave background about how shit at home has clearly affected how I interact with others.
17/08/2017, 22:26 - Dhaani: We're still at the stage where I am just getting her up to date with what my life is. 😅
17/08/2017, 22:26 - Dhaani: That should take another session or two.

-Sci-Fi + Mystery
-Magic/Fantasy
17/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: Dark/Horror
17/08/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: Umm. You sure about that ?
17/08/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: Yes
17/08/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: It is nsfw and has gore. I'll warn ya
17/08/2017, 22:57 - Dhaani: That's ok
17/08/2017, 23:07 - Munjaal: *Monster*
For a dark, realistic and philosophical plot. Throws the protagonist against his morals and makes him question his decisions.
Somewhat lengthy and slow.

*Elfen Lied*
Extremely brutal gore and blood. Non-sexually portrayed nudity. Wouldn't recommend as a starter.

*Death Parade*
Involves games where the participants actually die. A game of two,usually 2 people knowing each other,with the loser suffering.
17/08/2017, 23:08 - Dhaani: Ohkay
17/08/2017, 23:08 - Munjaal: I skipped certain parts to avoid spoilers

17/08/2017, 23:10 - Dhaani: I can't tomorrow. Going with Manish's old friend to receive him at the airport after college.
17/08/2017, 23:10 - Dhaani: And I don't know what next week looks like just yet.
17/08/2017, 23:13 - Munjaal: Hmm. Alright

30/08/2017, 23:48 - Dhaani: Not really.
30/08/2017, 23:48 - Dhaani: Also, heart rate was fluctuating again.
30/08/2017, 23:49 - Munjaal: 🙁
30/08/2017, 23:49 - Munjaal: How much ?
30/08/2017, 23:49 - Dhaani: Not too high

30/08/2017, 23:53 - Dhaani: Yup.
30/08/2017, 23:54 - Dhaani: I've been thoda emotional.
30/08/2017, 23:55 - Munjaal: Free Tip:Washing your face with cold ( not too cold ) water slows the heart rate. Mammalian Diving Response. Not sure if it will work when it is stress related but I'd say give it a shot.
30/08/2017, 23:56 - Dhaani: It works. I've tried it.
30/08/2017, 23:57 - Dhaani: Something cold to drink also works.
30/08/2017, 23:58 - Dhaani: Down to 77 now.
30/08/2017, 23:58 - Munjaal: Been thinking about the recent events a lot ?
30/08/2017, 23:58 - Dhaani: Can you blame me?
30/08/2017, 23:59 - Munjaal: Nope. I can neither blame nor advice. Only empathize
31/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: I can throw a pizza at you next time.
31/08/2017, 00:00 - Dhaani: I'll be fine in a few days yaa

31/08/2017, 00:01 - Munjaal: With some good chocolates
31/08/2017, 00:01 - Dhaani: 😅
31/08/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: I have no path to do so, and I wouldn't even if I had one.
31/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: Thank you
31/08/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: Just making sure.

31/08/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: Thanks
31/08/2017, 00:03 - Munjaal: Just don't say you're fine if you aren't.
31/08/2017, 00:04 - Munjaal: I'm slow at processing stuff to boot

31/08/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: Not even at nights ?
31/08/2017, 00:29 - Dhaani: Most days, not left alone till I am too tired.
31/08/2017, 00:30 - Munjaal: That's sad
31/08/2017, 00:33 - Munjaal: In terms of getting personal space. Our situations are in stark contrast

02/09/2017, 20:56 - Dhaani: But that was because old friend was visiting.
02/09/2017, 20:56 - Dhaani: We ended up staying up till 4:30am just reading poetry.
02/09/2017, 20:56 - Munjaal: 😂😂
02/09/2017, 20:56 - Munjaal: Typical Dhaani stuff
02/09/2017, 20:56 - Munjaal: Don't get to hear that from normal people
02/09/2017, 20:57 - Dhaani: I know, right?

03/09/2017, 22:34 - Munjaal: Yup 😛
03/09/2017, 22:36 - Dhaani: What did I ever do to deserve a friend like you?
03/09/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: Hahahaha
03/09/2017, 22:37 - Munjaal: I could say the same 😋
03/09/2017, 22:40 - Dhaani: Nah. I've hardly done anything for you.
03/09/2017, 22:41 - Munjaal: really now ? 😑
03/09/2017, 22:41 - Dhaani: Yup.
03/09/2017, 22:41 - Munjaal: I know I can rely on you in times of trouble and I have. Isn't that more than what most people offer ?
03/09/2017, 22:42 - Dhaani: Not really.
03/09/2017, 22:46 - Munjaal: 😑 you cannot win here. Me wins. STAHP

03/09/2017, 22:49 - Munjaal: 😁 good
03/09/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: But why the sudden interest in a scooty ?
03/09/2017, 22:56 - Dhaani: Going to Goa for two days
03/09/2017, 23:00 - Munjaal: 😃
03/09/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: Then won't a bike be best ??
03/09/2017, 23:01 - Dhaani: Maybe. But don't have much time na.
03/09/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: Same scheme applies.
03/09/2017, 23:03 - Dhaani: First scooty. Then we'll see
03/09/2017, 23:03 - Dhaani: When do your tests end?
03/09/2017, 23:04 - Munjaal: Tests end on Wednesday

03/09/2017, 23:09 - Dhaani: I don't know.
03/09/2017, 23:09 - Munjaal: Hmm
03/09/2017, 23:10 - Dhaani: I'll try to
03/09/2017, 23:11 - Munjaal: Just try not to over exhaust yourself first 🙄
03/09/2017, 23:12 - Dhaani: Baba, not overexerting these days.
03/09/2017, 23:12 - Munjaal: Just putting it out there
03/09/2017, 23:15 - Dhaani: Haan baba
03/09/2017, 23:20 - Munjaal: Will you be sleeping early ?
03/09/2017, 23:23 - Dhaani: Don't know
03/09/2017, 23:57 - Munjaal: Okay
03/09/2017, 23:58 - Munjaal: If you're up and not occupied, can you call up ?
04/09/2017, 00:00 - Dhaani: I am awake but so is dad. Give me a few minutes?
04/09/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: Aaram se. Even I'm exercising.
04/09/2017, 00:09 - Dhaani: Alright
04/09/2017, 01:22 - Munjaal: Working out when you have a cold really isn't a good idea.
04/09/2017, 18:38 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
04/09/2017, 18:39 - Munjaal: Hand for scale. Is this too large ?
04/09/2017, 18:41 - Dhaani: Too large
04/09/2017, 18:42 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
04/09/2017, 18:42 - Munjaal: This okay ?
04/09/2017, 18:49 - Dhaani: I think so
04/09/2017, 18:49 - Dhaani: But marginally smaller might be better
04/09/2017, 20:34 - Munjaal: Welp
04/09/2017, 20:35 - Munjaal: It's done 😅
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Dhaani: 😃
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Munjaal: It might be too large.
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Munjaal: 😅😅
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Dhaani: Nah. It's ok
04/09/2017, 20:36 - Munjaal: I'll add the layer tomorrow
05/09/2017, 10:41 - Munjaal: Holiday today ?
05/09/2017, 10:42 - Dhaani: Yup
05/09/2017, 10:43 - Munjaal: Nice. Rest day
05/09/2017, 10:43 - Dhaani: Sort of.
05/09/2017, 10:44 - Munjaal: Home issues ?
05/09/2017, 10:44 - Dhaani: Yes.
05/09/2017, 10:44 - Dhaani: And my oldest friend has a cracked rib so I have to visit her.
05/09/2017, 10:45 - Munjaal: Cracked a rib ? That's bloody painful
05/09/2017, 10:46 - Dhaani: I know.
05/09/2017, 10:46 - Dhaani: She is on bed rest.
05/09/2017, 10:46 - Munjaal: I see
05/09/2017, 10:46 - Munjaal: Which hospital ?
05/09/2017, 10:46 - Munjaal: Or home
05/09/2017, 10:47 - Dhaani: Home.
05/09/2017, 10:47 - Munjaal: Hmm. I thought rib fractures require hospitalisation
05/09/2017, 10:48 - Munjaal: Good though. Home is better
05/09/2017, 10:48 - Dhaani: Not a fracture fracture na, minor crack.
05/09/2017, 10:48 - Dhaani: Not that that's much better
05/09/2017, 10:48 - Munjaal: yeah.
05/09/2017, 10:49 - Munjaal: You haven't broken any home yet have you ?
05/09/2017, 10:50 - Munjaal: *bone (wtf Google keyboard)
05/09/2017, 10:50 - Dhaani: Nope
05/09/2017, 23:54 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>

06/09/2017, 01:42 - Dhaani: I am sleeping in the next 15 minutes
06/09/2017, 01:42 - Dhaani: Have to wake up at 6:30.

06/09/2017, 08:26 - Dhaani: Yup
06/09/2017, 08:27 - Munjaal: May I ask till when ?
06/09/2017, 08:29 - Dhaani: 5.
06/09/2017, 08:29 - Dhaani: Why?
06/09/2017, 08:30 - Munjaal: Aise hi. Have a nice day ✌🏻
06/09/2017, 08:30 - Dhaani: Have to drop by Khar for some work afterwards.
06/09/2017, 08:30 - Dhaani: I don't feel like doing anything.
06/09/2017, 08:30 - Munjaal: 😂😂 We're in the same boat
06/09/2017, 08:31 - Dhaani: BP is marginally high but feeling uneasy already.
06/09/2017, 08:31 - Munjaal: Reduce salt intake for the day
06/09/2017, 08:32 - Dhaani: Yup.
06/09/2017, 08:32 - Dhaani: And coffee intake.
06/09/2017, 08:32 - Dhaani: But I shouldn't be uneasy at these readings.
06/09/2017, 08:33 - Munjaal: Temperature normal ? And any body ache ?
06/09/2017, 08:34 - Dhaani: Slight bodyache. I think temperature is normal.
06/09/2017, 08:34 - Dhaani: Even bp is just 126/93. Which isn't too bad.
06/09/2017, 08:35 - Dhaani: 93 may be the problem
06/09/2017, 08:35 - Munjaal: Yeah. Keep an eye on your heart rate as well.
06/09/2017, 08:35 - Dhaani: Ya. Morning it was 88 or so.
06/09/2017, 08:35 - Dhaani: I'll check when I get to college.
06/09/2017, 08:36 - Munjaal: Alright. Keep me posted if there's any changes please
06/09/2017, 08:37 - Dhaani: Head feels thoda heavy and stretched.
06/09/2017, 08:38 - Munjaal: You might have pre-hypertension
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Munjaal: Don't worry though. Just need to be thoda careful
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Dhaani: Not worried
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Dhaani: Just blah.
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Munjaal: 😂
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Dhaani: Don't feel good.
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Dhaani: Going to the doctor this evening.
06/09/2017, 08:39 - Munjaal: Yeah. Please do
06/09/2017, 08:40 - Dhaani: Since bp has been around this or higher consistently for a while now.
06/09/2017, 08:41 - Munjaal: Yup. Hopefully it's only pre-hypertension
06/09/2017, 08:41 - Munjaal: 🤞🏻
06/09/2017, 08:42 - Dhaani: I hope my doctor doesn't try to prescribe sleeping pills again.
06/09/2017, 08:42 - Munjaal: lol what ? You mean to tell me you were prescribed sleeping pills by a doctor ?
06/09/2017, 08:43 - Dhaani: Yes. About one year back.
06/09/2017, 08:43 - Dhaani: I refused to take them.
06/09/2017, 08:43 - Dhaani: There is an annoying pressure in my ears.
06/09/2017, 08:44 - Munjaal: Do you have cold and/or cough ?
06/09/2017, 08:44 - Dhaani: Nope.
06/09/2017, 08:45 - Munjaal: A chewing gum can help with that
06/09/2017, 08:45 - Dhaani: Don't have that.
06/09/2017, 08:45 - Dhaani: And can't chew gum in the lab
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Munjaal: Ah lel
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Dhaani: Bahhh
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Dhaani: I feel like sleeping today
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Dhaani: I know I am being a whiny kid right now.
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Dhaani: But I want to sleep.
06/09/2017, 08:46 - Munjaal: 😂😂
06/09/2017, 08:48 - Dhaani: 🙈
06/09/2017, 08:48 - Munjaal: Your kid version is rare
06/09/2017, 08:49 - Dhaani: Nooooo
06/09/2017, 08:49 - Munjaal: 👶🏻
06/09/2017, 08:49 - Dhaani: 👵🏼
06/09/2017, 08:49 - Munjaal: Oh. And you didn't sleep much either
06/09/2017, 08:50 - Dhaani: Slept enough.
06/09/2017, 08:50 - Munjaal: Enough by your standards, not by the body's requirement 😒
06/09/2017, 08:50 - Dhaani: Haan but didn't have an option na.
06/09/2017, 08:51 - Dhaani: Messy scenes at home last night.
06/09/2017, 08:51 - Munjaal: Kya hua ? 🙁
06/09/2017, 08:51 - Munjaal: If I may ask
06/09/2017, 08:53 - Dhaani: Nevermind that yaa
06/09/2017, 08:53 - Dhaani: I feel worse now than when I left home.
06/09/2017, 08:53 - Munjaal: Where are you ?
06/09/2017, 08:53 - Dhaani: In a cab
06/09/2017, 08:54 - Dhaani: On the highway
06/09/2017, 08:54 - Munjaal: Shared ?
06/09/2017, 08:54 - Dhaani: Yup.
06/09/2017, 08:55 - Munjaal: Hmm. You could take the day off. If attendance is not an issue
06/09/2017, 08:55 - Dhaani: I don't know whether it is, honestly. But need to submit the stipend form. 😓
06/09/2017, 08:56 - Munjaal: Do that and leave
06/09/2017, 08:56 - Dhaani: I get unwell too often yaa
06/09/2017, 08:56 - Munjaal: Unless you are very sure you'll be able to handle the condition
06/09/2017, 08:56 - Munjaal: That's alright. Happens
06/09/2017, 08:57 - Dhaani: I should be able to handle it.
06/09/2017, 08:58 - Munjaal: 😕 okay
06/09/2017, 09:04 - Dhaani: 😊
06/09/2017, 09:09 - Munjaal: Lemme know if you leave early ?
06/09/2017, 09:16 - Dhaani: Will do.
06/09/2017, 09:18 - Dhaani: Is nausea linked to BP in any way?
06/09/2017, 09:21 - Munjaal: Linked to low BP not high
06/09/2017, 09:22 - Dhaani: Strange.
06/09/2017, 09:26 - Munjaal: Weakness and lack of sleep can cause that too
06/09/2017, 09:26 - Dhaani: That might be it then.
06/09/2017, 09:29 - Munjaal: Please take care
06/09/2017, 09:29 - Dhaani: Taking care.
06/09/2017, 09:32 - Munjaal: Extra today
06/09/2017, 09:33 - Dhaani: Yup
06/09/2017, 10:58 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
06/09/2017, 11:15 - Munjaal: 😕
06/09/2017, 11:15 - Munjaal: It's mostly because of whatever happened yesterday
06/09/2017, 11:16 - Dhaani: Maybe. It's been shooting up occasionally anyway
06/09/2017, 12:05 - Dhaani: Left college
06/09/2017, 12:05 - Dhaani: Happy my face had started twitching weirdly
06/09/2017, 12:14 - Munjaal: 😐
06/09/2017, 12:15 - Dhaani: *half my face
06/09/2017, 12:15 - Dhaani: Not happy

06/09/2017, 12:19 - Dhaani: Meeting a friend
06/09/2017, 12:19 - Dhaani: He'll take care.
06/09/2017, 12:19 - Dhaani: Home isn't rest.
06/09/2017, 12:19 - Dhaani: Currently I need rest.
06/09/2017, 12:20 - Munjaal: Good good
06/09/2017, 12:21 - Munjaal: Had you not left I was gonna drop by
06/09/2017, 12:21 - Dhaani: All the way to matunga?
06/09/2017, 12:21 - Dhaani: For what joy?
06/09/2017, 12:22 - Munjaal: It's 15 mins from Vile Parle
06/09/2017, 12:22 - Munjaal: 20 max
06/09/2017, 12:22 - Dhaani: But college is another 20 minutes away
06/09/2017, 12:22 - Munjaal: So 35 mins. Doable
06/09/2017, 12:24 - Dhaani: Again, for what joy?
06/09/2017, 12:24 - Dhaani: And is your test done? I am so sorry, I completely forgot about it.
06/09/2017, 12:28 - Munjaal: Wasn't feeling well yesterday so I couldn't study. Walked out.
06/09/2017, 12:28 - Munjaal: Don't apologize 😑
06/09/2017, 12:28 - Dhaani: 😐
06/09/2017, 12:28 - Dhaani: What happened to you yesterday?
06/09/2017, 12:28 - Munjaal: Body and headache
Nothing serious
06/09/2017, 12:29 - Dhaani: 😐
06/09/2017, 12:29 - Munjaal: And a very dry subject so no mood
06/09/2017, 12:29 - Dhaani: Dehydration?
06/09/2017, 12:29 - Munjaal: Dunno. Shouldn't be the case.
06/09/2017, 12:30 - Dhaani: Alright
06/09/2017, 12:30 - Dhaani: I need to mention the face twitching to the doctor, don't I?
06/09/2017, 12:31 - Munjaal: Where on the face ?
06/09/2017, 12:32 - Dhaani: Mouth. One side of my mouth started pulling downwards. I felt the pull go down to my neck.
06/09/2017, 17:49 - Munjaal: Hello. How are you feeling now ?
06/09/2017, 19:43 - Munjaal: Stenosis (Either Mitral or Aortic)
06/09/2017, 19:43 - Munjaal: or Aortic Sclerosis
06/09/2017, 19:44 - Munjaal: I'm almost sure about my accuracy. 😼

08/09/2017, 22:38 - Munjaal: Feeling weak
08/09/2017, 22:39 - Dhaani: Will you go to a doctor?
08/09/2017, 22:39 - Dhaani: This has been too long
08/09/2017, 22:39 - Munjaal: Yeah. Tomorrow
08/09/2017, 22:43 - Dhaani: Good
08/09/2017, 22:43 - Dhaani: Sleep early?
08/09/2017, 22:44 - Munjaal: Wouldn't be able to stay up late even if I wanted to
08/09/2017, 22:45 - Dhaani: 😐
08/09/2017, 22:45 - Dhaani: You're definitely not going
08/09/2017, 22:45 - Dhaani: And you're going to the doctor tomorrow
08/09/2017, 22:45 - Munjaal: 😅 yup. Called him and cancelled

08/09/2017, 22:50 - Munjaal: I meant. With the medicine
08/09/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Not taking it.
08/09/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: gonna make mom believe you're taking em ?
08/09/2017, 22:51 - Dhaani: Yup.
08/09/2017, 22:52 - Dhaani: Though mum asked me not to take lonazep in the morning because it would make me foggy.
08/09/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: So.... She knows it would make you doggy
08/09/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: Lol , *foggy
08/09/2017, 22:53 - Munjaal: 🐶
08/09/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: Yup
08/09/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: She looked at my prescription. Pointed out that dad was prescribed that once.
08/09/2017, 22:54 - Dhaani: And asked me to Google it for her.
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: That's..... Weird
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: But still expects me to take it in the evenings.
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: an act ?
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: And take the other pill thrice a day.
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: I don't know.
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: At this point, I just don't know.
08/09/2017, 22:55 - Munjaal: So did you tell her about the drug from Google
08/09/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: And if so, if you've mostly mentioned that it nowhere mentions blood pressure
08/09/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: I wouldn't see why you would have to take it
08/09/2017, 22:56 - Dhaani: Yup. And she still expects me to take it in the evenings. Because doctor prescribed it.
08/09/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: Wtf 😑
08/09/2017, 22:57 - Dhaani: "Doctor knows better. "
08/09/2017, 22:57 - Munjaal: Well. T'was not a doctor that told me not to chew cherry pits.
08/09/2017, 22:59 - Dhaani: Ya well.
08/09/2017, 23:02 - Munjaal: I'd *consider* buying that in 2007
08/09/2017, 23:02 - Dhaani: I know.
09/09/2017, 20:58 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
09/09/2017, 20:58 - Munjaal: this is exactly what im talking about.
09/09/2017, 22:13 - Dhaani: Wow
09/09/2017, 22:51 - Munjaal: :')
09/09/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: I'd do love to fly it that way
09/09/2017, 22:52 - Munjaal: *so
09/09/2017, 22:53 - Dhaani: Of course you would.
09/09/2017, 22:54 - Munjaal: What's up?
09/09/2017, 22:55 - Dhaani: Nothing yaa
09/09/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: Hmm
09/09/2017, 22:56 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
09/09/2017, 22:57 - Dhaani: 😅
11/09/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: Hello
11/09/2017, 00:24 - Dhaani: Hi
11/09/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: Wassup ?
11/09/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Lying in bed.
11/09/2017, 00:25 - Munjaal: Hmm. Mom's there ?
11/09/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Nahi
11/09/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: Can I call ?
11/09/2017, 00:28 - Dhaani: Two minutes
11/09/2017, 00:29 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
11/09/2017, 00:29 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
11/09/2017, 00:30 - Munjaal: Eh what the hell.
11/09/2017, 00:30 - Munjaal: Does it hurt or only blackened ?
11/09/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: Only blackened
11/09/2017, 00:33 - Munjaal: If it doesn't hurt that means only superficial capillaries have somehow burst
11/09/2017, 00:34 - Munjaal: Something similar to what happens when you suck on an arm for instance. Turns red but enough pressure and it blackens
11/09/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: I'm so very sorry
11/09/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: Something urgent popped up
11/09/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: You awake ?
11/09/2017, 12:57 - Munjaal: So there's good news and bad
11/09/2017, 12:58 - Dhaani: Tell me
11/09/2017, 12:59 - Munjaal: But before that. What meds were you given now ?
11/09/2017, 13:14 - Dhaani: Couldn't go to the doctor this morning. Will go in the evening.
11/09/2017, 14:05 - Munjaal: Oh okay
11/09/2017, 17:40 - Munjaal: Lemme know what the doc says
11/09/2017, 18:01 - Dhaani: Tell me
11/09/2017, 18:02 - Munjaal: Good news: I'm in love ❤
11/09/2017, 18:04 - Dhaani: Go on
11/09/2017, 18:04 - Dhaani: I expect a twist there.
11/09/2017, 18:05 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
11/09/2017, 18:05 - Dhaani: Of course
11/09/2017, 18:05 - Munjaal: What's wrong 😒 ?
11/09/2017, 18:11 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
11/09/2017, 18:12 - Dhaani: Oh woe
11/09/2017, 18:12 - Dhaani: *wow
11/09/2017, 18:12 - Munjaal: 😏

11/09/2017, 18:29 - Munjaal: Oh okay
11/09/2017, 19:03 - Dhaani: Her studio is here
11/09/2017, 19:03 - Dhaani: Oye, can you do me a favour?
11/09/2017, 19:04 - Munjaal: Yeah
11/09/2017, 19:05 - Dhaani: Can you just search and see if you can find a python thing to detect qrs complex in an ecg signal?
11/09/2017, 19:05 - Munjaal: Alright
11/09/2017, 19:05 - Munjaal: By ?

12/09/2017, 01:19 - Munjaal: Alright
12/09/2017, 10:04 - Dhaani: So the doctor wants me to continue lonazep for a month.
12/09/2017, 10:59 - Munjaal: Address please.
12/09/2017, 11:54 - Dhaani: Bo
12/09/2017, 11:54 - Dhaani: *no
12/09/2017, 11:54 - Dhaani: He also asked me to visit a cardiologist
12/09/2017, 12:14 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
12/09/2017, 12:22 - Munjaal: ....
12/09/2017, 12:23 - Dhaani: What?
12/09/2017, 12:24 - Munjaal: Sitting ?
12/09/2017, 12:24 - Dhaani: Yes.
12/09/2017, 12:24 - Munjaal: Hmm
12/09/2017, 12:24 - Munjaal: Feeling normal? Besides the anger/frustration
12/09/2017, 12:24 - Dhaani: Came down to 116 now.
12/09/2017, 12:25 - Dhaani: Thoda dazed.
12/09/2017, 12:25 - Dhaani: Head hurts and feels pressurized
12/09/2017, 12:25 - Dhaani: Same old.
12/09/2017, 12:25 - Munjaal: At college?
12/09/2017, 12:25 - Dhaani: On my way to Vikhroli. Running thoda late.
12/09/2017, 12:26 - Munjaal: Hmm. Water intake ?
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Dhaani: Normal. Making an effort to maintain normal water intake.
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Munjaal: Okay
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Dhaani: Pressure in my ears as well.
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Dhaani: Don't want to go to work
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Munjaal: Any sort of cough ? Or congestion ?
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Dhaani: But have taken too many days off.
12/09/2017, 12:27 - Dhaani: Nope.
12/09/2017, 12:29 - Munjaal: Weird
12/09/2017, 12:29 - Munjaal: You have a friend near your work place na ?
12/09/2017, 12:33 - Dhaani: Yes.
12/09/2017, 12:33 - Dhaani: I don't know if he is home today but yes.
12/09/2017, 12:33 - Munjaal: Ask him maybe ?
12/09/2017, 12:34 - Munjaal: In case your health starts behaving again
12/09/2017, 12:35 - Dhaani: Will do.
13/09/2017, 14:13 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
13/09/2017, 14:23 - Dhaani: Fair enough
13/09/2017, 16:18 - Munjaal: Not referring to myself. General idea
13/09/2017, 18:42 - Dhaani: Alright
13/09/2017, 18:42 - Dhaani: So weird thing.
13/09/2017, 18:43 - Munjaal: Yea
13/09/2017, 18:44 - Munjaal: ?
13/09/2017, 18:45 - Dhaani: Yesterday, at work, my BP and heart rate went up.
13/09/2017, 18:45 - Dhaani: 158/98. We checked twice.
13/09/2017, 18:45 - Dhaani: And heart rate was about 120.
13/09/2017, 18:46 - Dhaani: So I rushed home.
13/09/2017, 18:46 - Dhaani: Because I was supposed to go to a cardiologist during a spike.
13/09/2017, 18:46 - Dhaani: But since I got home, my readings have been perfect.
13/09/2017, 18:47 - Munjaal: lol
13/09/2017, 18:47 - Munjaal: When God wants you to take a half day
13/09/2017, 18:47 - Dhaani: But you understand how strange that is?
13/09/2017, 18:47 - Dhaani: That was a worryingly high reading
13/09/2017, 18:47 - Munjaal: Yeah. Quite high
13/09/2017, 18:48 - Munjaal: Umm
13/09/2017, 18:48 - Munjaal: Can you consult another doctor please ?
13/09/2017, 18:48 - Dhaani: I am supposed to consult a cardiologist.
13/09/2017, 18:49 - Dhaani: But that had to be when my readings are high
13/09/2017, 18:49 - Munjaal: Start making an hourly log if you can
13/09/2017, 18:49 - Munjaal: That would help a lot
13/09/2017, 18:49 - Dhaani: Parents will get really annoyed if I check that often.
13/09/2017, 18:50 - Munjaal: Keep the blood pressure machine in your bag. Check outside home when you're travelling or at work
13/09/2017, 18:50 - Munjaal: Heart rate you have your phone
13/09/2017, 18:50 - Dhaani: Can't do that. They'll notice it gone.
13/09/2017, 18:51 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
13/09/2017, 18:55 - Dhaani: No Munjaal
13/09/2017, 18:55 - Dhaani: Hard to hide things.
13/09/2017, 19:02 - Munjaal: Hmm :/

14/09/2017, 18:52 - Munjaal: Hmm. Weird but nice
14/09/2017, 18:53 - Dhaani: I know.
14/09/2017, 18:53 - Dhaani: It just suddenly stopped.
14/09/2017, 18:53 - Munjaal: 😂😂
14/09/2017, 18:53 - Dhaani: But I have a swollen and red eye.
14/09/2017, 18:53 - Dhaani: Funny thing, Maani and a pulled a twin thing here. 
She has conjunctivitis in the same eye today.
14/09/2017, 18:54 - Munjaal: Wow. She's home ?
14/09/2017, 18:54 - Munjaal: If so then not much of a coincidence
14/09/2017, 18:54 - Dhaani: Nope. Gurgaon
14/09/2017, 18:54 - Munjaal: WOW ..

16/10/2017, 14:22 - Munjaal: Alright
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: Your gift is finalized and this is the only time I can boast to say you're gonna love it (cause you said so yourself) :P
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: Thought this might make you feel better :P
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Dhaani: Huh
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Dhaani: Nooooo
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Dhaani: I have to wait almost a month!
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Munjaal: hehehe
16/10/2017, 14:40 - Dhaani: With this kind of curiosity!
16/10/2017, 14:41 - Munjaal: It's finalized, still haven;t made it yet
16/10/2017, 14:41 - Dhaani: And a mild dose of guilt
16/10/2017, 14:41 - Munjaal: Guilt for what ?
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Dhaani: Because you're putting in effort and timr
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Dhaani: *time
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Munjaal: Worth it. For me at least
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Dhaani: And I don't do nearly enough for you
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Munjaal: We aren't keeping scores 😑
16/10/2017, 14:42 - Munjaal: and don't have to
16/10/2017, 14:43 - Dhaani: And about keeping score
16/10/2017, 14:43 - Dhaani: I just don't know what I ever did to deserve such a wonderful friend. 😅
16/10/2017, 14:44 - Munjaal: You have many many wonderful friends. This one's just a little loose up there 😋
16/10/2017, 14:44 - Dhaani: Exactly! I have many wonderful friends
16/10/2017, 14:44 - Dhaani: And I don't deserve any of them
16/10/2017, 14:44 - Dhaani: Makes me feel thoda guilty
16/10/2017, 14:44 - Munjaal: 🙄
16/10/2017, 14:50 - Munjaal: Idiot
16/10/2017, 14:55 - Dhaani: Me writing today!
16/10/2017, 14:55 - Munjaal: Share share
16/10/2017, 14:56 - Dhaani: For all that it is worth 
It was worth my life 
But that means nothing at all 
Raise the stakes 
Let me trade up 
Lay down something too good to give up 
Just to say 
For all that it is worth 
As I look you in the eye
And walk away.
16/10/2017, 14:57 - Dhaani: Once 
One more time 
Once again 
Lose count of the countdown 
Till it ends 
And catches me like a punch in the gut 
The expected, yet not the anticipated 
Is what throws me off 
The monster I built is not what I see 
And the one I see 
I can't control 
What I see is no monster 
It refuses to keep form 
Long enough for a sense of closure 
A trap that serves as a reprieve
16/10/2017, 14:59 - Munjaal: Specific mood trigger this ?
16/10/2017, 15:00 - Dhaani: Nah. Watching prison break while writing.
16/10/2017, 15:00 - Munjaal: What ? 😑 Wah
16/10/2017, 15:00 - Dhaani: And was doodling

16/10/2017, 15:02 - Dhaani: What?
16/10/2017, 15:02 - Dhaani: What did you think of the two pieces?
16/10/2017, 15:03 - Munjaal: They have a similar theme the way I interpret. Thus I thought 👆🏻
16/10/2017, 15:03 - Munjaal: Really like the first one
16/10/2017, 15:12 - Dhaani: Don't like the second one?
16/10/2017, 15:19 - Munjaal: I do
16/10/2017, 15:20 - Munjaal: But the first one seems more .... relatable ?
16/10/2017, 15:21 - Munjaal: Dunno

22/10/2017, 10:20 - Munjaal: Your cab theory also has a slight logical loophole
22/10/2017, 10:20 - Dhaani: Which is?
22/10/2017, 10:20 - Munjaal: You're home ?
22/10/2017, 10:21 - Munjaal: If the waiting time was high and her friend had to leave. She could have marked a cab from her friend's place to home while traveling
22/10/2017, 10:21 - Dhaani: Yes.
22/10/2017, 10:22 - Munjaal: But hopefully your mom wouldn't think so much
22/10/2017, 10:22 - Dhaani: Her friend lives all the way in town.
22/10/2017, 10:22 - Dhaani: Let's hope so. I just want to sleep.

07/11/2017, 16:01 - Dhaani: In a while?
07/11/2017, 16:02 - Munjaal: Okay
07/11/2017, 16:28 - Dhaani: Your phone isn't reachable
07/11/2017, 20:22 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/11/2017, 20:49 - Dhaani: Who else?
07/11/2017, 21:22 - Munjaal: me myself and I
07/11/2017, 21:22 - Munjaal: best friends :P
07/11/2017, 21:22 - Dhaani: 😒
07/11/2017, 21:23 - Munjaal: 😅
07/11/2017, 21:23 - Munjaal: Ah I really miss the old emojis
07/11/2017, 21:23 - Munjaal: the new ones are shit
07/11/2017, 21:23 - Dhaani: I know!
07/11/2017, 21:23 - Munjaal: Too shiny and glittery and rainbowey
07/11/2017, 21:24 - Dhaani: https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-Touchscreen-MaxxAudio-RealSense/dp/B06XD6NPFW/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1510069885&sr=1-8&keywords=dell%2Binspiron&refinements=p_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A13580790011%2Cp_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A5446812011%2Cp_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A2289792011&th=1
07/11/2017, 21:24 - Dhaani: What do you think of this?
07/11/2017, 21:25 - Munjaal: Intel HD 520 Internal Graphics only
07/11/2017, 21:26 - Munjaal: Say bye bye to running any heavy application, forget Neural Networks
07/11/2017, 21:27 - Dhaani: So I am getting really conflicting advice about that
07/11/2017, 21:27 - Munjaal: Let me give you a technical comparison between the most basic dedicated Nvidia GPU and Intel HD 520
07/11/2017, 21:27 - Munjaal: wait a min
07/11/2017, 21:28 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/11/2017, 21:31 - Munjaal: Oh and a common counterargument to this would be that 1050 is an external card and the laptop version will be weaker.
In reality , 10 Series onwards the difference in Mobile/Laptop versions and Dedicated External cards is about 10% only
07/11/2017, 22:02 - Dhaani: Ohkay
07/11/2017, 22:03 - Munjaal: That thing is an entertainment laptop
07/11/2017, 22:04 - Munjaal: 6500U is dual core
07/11/2017, 22:04 - Munjaal: Touchscreen is unnecessary IMO

14/11/2017, 02:29 - Dhaani: Yesss
14/11/2017, 02:30 - Munjaal: Something related to TOR and onion sites
14/11/2017, 02:30 - Dhaani: TOR?

14/11/2017, 17:09 - Dhaani: So sweet
14/11/2017, 21:06 - Munjaal: Everything's clear 😑
14/11/2017, 21:06 - Munjaal: Blood wasted !!
14/11/2017, 21:10 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
14/11/2017, 21:17 - Dhaani: Yay!
14/11/2017, 21:17 - Munjaal: 😑
14/11/2017, 21:17 - Munjaal: Means I've been "sick" cause my immune system is retarded. Not because of something significant
14/11/2017, 21:18 - Munjaal: That's just lame
14/11/2017, 21:44 - Dhaani: What to do now?
14/11/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Was given antibiotics
14/11/2017, 21:56 - Munjaal: Have to take them for 10 days and go again
14/11/2017, 22:46 - Dhaani: That's not so bad
14/11/2017, 23:46 - Dhaani: Give me details. What happened at the doctor's?
15/11/2017, 01:06 - Munjaal: So I have a kind of chronic sinusitis
15/11/2017, 01:06 - Munjaal: And there's this bacterium in the lungs
15/11/2017, 01:06 - Munjaal: He gave me the meds for 10 days. Then he'll check if it still persists
15/11/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: If it does , he'll up the strength and try again
15/11/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: Worst case scenario is it keeps developing resistance
15/11/2017, 01:07 - Munjaal: Best case scenario is it gets eliminated in the first course
15/11/2017, 01:08 - Dhaani: What happens then?
15/11/2017, 01:08 - Munjaal: Will be given an IV
15/11/2017, 01:08 - Munjaal: Hospitalisation
15/11/2017, 01:09 - Dhaani: Ohkay
15/11/2017, 01:09 - Munjaal: Cause there's only like 2 eatable meds remaining to which it is sensitive. Others are over IV
15/11/2017, 01:10 - Dhaani: Alright
15/11/2017, 01:10 - Dhaani: Let's see

15/11/2017, 12:48 - Munjaal: A week almost and the first antibiotics didn't work on her
15/11/2017, 12:55 - Dhaani: She is getting tests done as well. It'll be fine...
15/11/2017, 12:59 - Munjaal: She's having chest and stomach aches. Not characteristic of a viral
15/11/2017, 12:59 - Munjaal: 😕😕

19/11/2017, 23:59 - Dhaani: Or you're seeing one tomorrow?
19/11/2017, 23:59 - Munjaal: I have. I'm on antibiotics as well
19/11/2017, 23:59 - Munjaal: Good ones
19/11/2017, 23:59 - Dhaani: And?
20/11/2017, 00:00 - Munjaal: Viral is not affected by antibiotics
20/11/2017, 00:00 - Munjaal: There's antivirals
20/11/2017, 00:00 - Dhaani: And?
20/11/2017, 00:00 - Munjaal: Basically gotta endure this shit
20/11/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: 😐
20/11/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: Ah well. That aside. What's up ?
20/11/2017, 00:02 - Munjaal: How's you
20/11/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: Not so good
20/11/2017, 00:02 - Dhaani: Things at home have been messy since Thursday. Long story.
20/11/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: Really dragged my down this time.
20/11/2017, 00:03 - Munjaal: I'm sorry I shouldn't have recklessly messaged like that
20/11/2017, 00:03 - Munjaal: You wanna meet ?
20/11/2017, 00:03 - Dhaani: Your going to rest and study

20/11/2017, 00:06 - Dhaani: Not sure
20/11/2017, 00:09 - Munjaal: 😓I shouldn't be going anywhere. I checked online, influenza is contagious
20/11/2017, 00:09 - Dhaani: Stay home and rest
20/11/2017, 00:09 - Munjaal: Gimme a call tomorrow ?
20/11/2017, 00:10 - Dhaani: Will do

Nvidia 1050Ti at 805$ - 52k INR
Nvidia 1060 at 969$ - 63k INR
22/11/2017, 09:34 - Munjaal: the base version has an AMD card which isn't widely supported
22/11/2017, 09:42 - Dhaani: Oh. I didn't check the difference in price for the different versions.

07/12/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: Yeah but he told me to come after a month so
07/12/2017, 00:23 - Munjaal: I kinda caught a viral and then common cold after that so he wants to check after these two are gone
07/12/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: Viral is gone but I don't think the cold's gonna go anytime soon. Let's see
07/12/2017, 08:35 - Dhaani: Well, I am glad the viral is gone

07/12/2017, 15:35 - Munjaal: Never been 'bad' you know
07/12/2017, 15:35 - Munjaal: Would have gone to the doctor way earlier if this was bothersome
07/12/2017, 15:35 - Munjaal: it's just 'there'
07/12/2017, 15:58 - Dhaani: Alright
07/12/2017, 23:51 - Dhaani: So what have you been up to?
08/12/2017, 00:25 - Munjaal: nothing much
08/12/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Munjaal, what's wrong?

08/12/2017, 19:55 - Dhaani: You need some rest
11/12/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: I never knew a game would make me admire poetry so much
11/12/2017, 22:19 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
12/12/2017, 13:47 - Munjaal: Well, the one who writes this is a super jolly person who's actually suffering from depression and later commits suicide
12/12/2017, 13:51 - Dhaani: I'll read later? Sorry.
12/12/2017, 14:03 - Munjaal: It's okay 😛

14/12/2017, 22:14 - Dhaani: I've seen it

25/12/2017, 19:49 - Munjaal: Thought I'd ask if you're going
25/12/2017, 19:51 - Dhaani: Tomorrow?
25/12/2017, 19:51 - Dhaani: I'll be in Vikhroli. 😔😢
25/12/2017, 19:53 - Munjaal: Oh okay
25/12/2017, 19:54 - Munjaal: That's actually better 😅 was planning to botch it any way
25/12/2017, 19:55 - Dhaani: Why? What competition?
25/12/2017, 19:56 - Munjaal: Done racing
25/12/2017, 19:56 - Munjaal: Long story 😛😅
25/12/2017, 20:17 - Munjaal: Drone
25/12/2017, 20:20 - Dhaani: Ohkay
26/12/2017, 22:24 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
26/12/2017, 22:25 - Dhaani: 😅
26/12/2017, 22:25 - Munjaal: 😛
26/12/2017, 23:01 - Munjaal: You cut the call before I could pick
27/12/2017, 00:22 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
27/12/2017, 02:25 - Munjaal: 😐
27/12/2017, 08:05 - Dhaani: Good morning
27/12/2017, 11:24 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/12/2017, 11:24 - Munjaal: Morning
27/12/2017, 12:26 - Dhaani: Good afternoon
27/12/2017, 13:17 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/12/2017, 13:18 - Munjaal: Gee thanks ! Such an amazing deal
27/12/2017, 13:18 - Dhaani: Hahaha
29/12/2017, 23:15 - Munjaal: Hey
29/12/2017, 23:39 - Dhaani: Hey
30/12/2017, 00:18 - Dhaani: She got home this morning.
30/12/2017, 00:19 - Dhaani: Threw a fit in from of guests.
30/12/2017, 00:19 - Dhaani: And then a tantrum when the guests had gone out for a while.
30/12/2017, 00:19 - Dhaani: Then, we went for a play in the evening with guests.
30/12/2017, 00:19 - Dhaani: On the way back, mum and dad went to drop them to the hotel .
30/12/2017, 00:19 - Dhaani: Maani and I were taking a cab home.
30/12/2017, 00:20 - Dhaani: In which time, she makes a call to someone and completely ignores me.
30/12/2017, 00:20 - Dhaani: As though I am her assistant and it is my job to make arrangements for her, while she ignores my existence.
30/12/2017, 00:20 - Dhaani: So I was getting bored in the cab
30/12/2017, 00:21 - Dhaani: And I realised it is past 12 and it is a common friend's birthday.
30/12/2017, 00:21 - Dhaani: So I called up to wish him.
30/12/2017, 00:21 - Dhaani: As soon as she realised who I was speaking to, she started screaming
30/12/2017, 00:21 - Dhaani: About how she reminded me about his birthday. Which isn't even true
30/12/2017, 00:24 - Munjaal: 😕
30/12/2017, 00:21 - Dhaani: And about how apparently that was a very shy and oversmart thing for me to do.
30/12/2017, 00:22 - Dhaani: Calling him in front of her. I would think that quietly wishing him without letting her find out would be sly, this was pretty straightforward behavior.
30/12/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: Then, when we got out of the cab, she took stairs for a change. Which is weird since she normally takes the lift and I take the stairs.
30/12/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: And as soon as I started climbing the stairs, she screams at me to stop following her and about how I need to give her some space.
30/12/2017, 00:23 - Dhaani: Like what was I supposed to do? Go out and sit on the road instead of going home?
30/12/2017, 00:26 - Munjaal: XD XD
30/12/2017, 00:27 - Munjaal: And you're the one who goes for counseling to a therapist
30/12/2017, 00:25 - Dhaani: Say something
30/12/2017, 00:28 - Munjaal: Clearly she needs it for a much stronger reason
30/12/2017, 00:26 - Dhaani: I can't deal with her yaa
30/12/2017, 00:27 - Dhaani: We'll be sharing a room till Monday.
30/12/2017, 00:32 - Munjaal: Yeah please no instinctive murdering
30/12/2017, 00:32 - Munjaal: Anyone
30/12/2017, 00:30 - Dhaani: Am I overreacting?
30/12/2017, 00:44 - Munjaal: Under
30/12/2017, 00:45 - Munjaal: If I may say so
30/12/2017, 00:49 - Dhaani: Forget it.
30/12/2017, 00:54 - Munjaal: Hey
30/12/2017, 00:55 - Munjaal: Gotta admit something
30/12/2017, 00:56 - Munjaal: Promise me you won't get mad
30/12/2017, 01:02 - Dhaani: Ok. Go on.
30/12/2017, 01:29 - Dhaani: I promise
30/12/2017, 12:55 - Dhaani: Munjaal?
30/12/2017, 12:59 - Munjaal: Ignore that. Melatonin makes you say stuff I guess.
30/12/2017, 13:00 - Dhaani: No.
30/12/2017, 13:00 - Dhaani: Talk to me.
30/12/2017, 13:01 - Munjaal: It's just
30/12/2017, 13:01 - Munjaal: I had barely slept, say for around 6 hours total in 72
30/12/2017, 13:02 - Munjaal: Was exhausted as well
30/12/2017, 13:02 - Munjaal: But under all that lack of sleep and exhaustion, I could finally feel good
30/12/2017, 13:03 - Munjaal: Not having energy to overthink , and be detached from everything almost feels like an incentive to deprive myself of sleep
30/12/2017, 13:05 - Dhaani: Unfortunately, I can relate to that
30/12/2017, 13:08 - Munjaal: 😔
30/12/2017, 13:07 - Dhaani: What's your plan today?
30/12/2017, 13:10 - Munjaal: besides having dealt with police right after I wake up (almost like stabbing a poisoned victim) and , I plan to complete the mechanism
30/12/2017, 13:10 - Munjaal: *police and BMC
30/12/2017, 13:10 - Dhaani: Kya?
30/12/2017, 13:11 - Munjaal: They were cutting trees in my society
30/12/2017, 13:11 - Munjaal: One of em over 40 years old
30/12/2017, 13:11 - Munjaal: Under some bullshit logic
30/12/2017, 13:11 - Dhaani: Ohkay
30/12/2017, 13:42 - Dhaani: Oi.
30/12/2017, 13:43 - Dhaani: You're working at home or in college?
30/12/2017, 14:09 - Munjaal: Jogeshwari
30/12/2017, 14:24 - Dhaani: Ohh
30/12/2017, 14:24 - Dhaani: Can I catch you?
30/12/2017, 14:24 - Dhaani: What time?
30/12/2017, 14:33 - Munjaal: I'll be there till 8
30/12/2017, 15:06 - Munjaal: Just lemme know when you've coming
30/12/2017, 15:07 - Munjaal: *if
30/12/2017, 16:19 - Dhaani: I really want to
30/12/2017, 16:19 - Dhaani: Still trying.
30/12/2017, 16:19 - Dhaani: But caught up with family.
30/12/2017, 16:43 - Munjaal: Hey
30/12/2017, 16:43 - Munjaal: It's alright
30/12/2017, 16:43 - Munjaal: I might have a change of plans as well
30/12/2017, 16:43 - Munjaal: We'll meet up some other day

12/01/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: Shit went down
12/01/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: Had to fill up
12/01/2018, 00:09 - Dhaani: Alright
12/01/2018, 00:10 - Munjaal: Don't be mad please
12/01/2018, 00:10 - Munjaal: 😔
12/01/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: I am sorry I haven't been around. Things have been a little stressful
12/01/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: Not mad baba. Just worried.
12/01/2018, 00:11 - Munjaal: You okay ? What's wrong ?
12/01/2018, 00:11 - Dhaani: I am ok.
12/01/2018, 00:11 - Dhaani: Nothing major baba. Don't worry about it.
12/01/2018, 00:11 - Munjaal: You sure ?
12/01/2018, 00:11 - Dhaani: Ya.
12/01/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: I am worried dad might wake up and overhear something.
12/01/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: And too tired to go to the balcony.
12/01/2018, 00:14 - Dhaani: Mum is out of town. I am home with dad.
12/01/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: Aah
12/01/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: Scenes at home ?
12/01/2018, 00:14 - Dhaani: His anxiety has been pretty bad. He hasn't gone to work at all this week.
12/01/2018, 00:14 - Dhaani: And he has been drinking everyday.
12/01/2018, 00:15 - Munjaal: 😐
12/01/2018, 00:15 - Munjaal: This doesn't happen when mum is around na ?
12/01/2018, 00:23 - Dhaani: Nahi.
12/01/2018, 00:23 - Dhaani: Oh and he started smoking again.
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Munjaal: 😐
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Dhaani: Yes, well.
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Munjaal: Casual or chain ?
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Dhaani: Being home alone with dad when he has anxiety doesn't normally end well for me.
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Munjaal: Heck even casual isn't good for him
12/01/2018, 00:24 - Dhaani: I don't know.
12/01/2018, 00:25 - Munjaal: Would getting in touch with his doctor be of any help ?
12/01/2018, 00:25 - Dhaani: He met his doctor yesterday.
12/01/2018, 00:26 - Munjaal: I meant you meeting his doctor
12/01/2018, 00:26 - Munjaal: Reporting this behaviour
12/01/2018, 00:26 - Dhaani: Nahi. I don't think so.
12/01/2018, 00:26 - Dhaani: We've done that before. Didn't help.
12/01/2018, 00:26 - Munjaal: The doctor's a snitch ? Or just plain useless ?
12/01/2018, 00:27 - Dhaani: Useless.
12/01/2018, 00:28 - Munjaal: 😔
12/01/2018, 00:28 - Dhaani: It's fine.
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Dhaani: Currently he isn't at his worst.
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Dhaani: Hasn't insulted me or anything this time.
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Dhaani: So far. Still a week to go.
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Munjaal: :/
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Dhaani: It's fine.
12/01/2018, 00:29 - Dhaani: I am fine.
12/01/2018, 00:30 - Munjaal: And I thought things were going slightly better since the day you told me he shared his poetry with you
12/01/2018, 00:30 - Dhaani: Oh that was a long time ago.
12/01/2018, 00:30 - Dhaani: He teamed up with Maani and insulted me 10 days ago.
12/01/2018, 00:31 - Dhaani: Ooh and Maani publicly humiliated me a couple times. Dad was rather supportive of her in that.
12/01/2018, 00:31 - Munjaal: 😔
12/01/2018, 00:31 - Dhaani: And now we're all going to take a family road trip at the end of this month.
12/01/2018, 00:32 - Dhaani: Supposedly parents' way of pampering me, if you'll believe it. 
They've actually convinced themselves of that.
12/01/2018, 00:33 - Munjaal: Wow
12/01/2018, 00:33 - Munjaal: Cause a road trip is what you need
12/01/2018, 00:33 - Dhaani: A road trip with all four of us!
12/01/2018, 00:33 - Dhaani: And cherry on the cake? I have motion sickness.
12/01/2018, 00:34 - Dhaani: I'll be sleeping most of the time to avoid throwing up.
12/01/2018, 00:34 - Munjaal: I'll drive besides your car blasting 'Highway to Hell' on repeat and full volume
12/01/2018, 00:34 - Dhaani: Hahahaha
12/01/2018, 00:35 - Munjaal: 😛
12/01/2018, 00:38 - Munjaal: Oi
12/01/2018, 00:38 - Munjaal: Promise me something
12/01/2018, 00:40 - Dhaani: Tell me
12/01/2018, 00:40 - Munjaal: You'll tell me if anything bothers you
12/01/2018, 00:42 - Munjaal: I'll never be burdened or weighed down by that.
12/01/2018, 00:42 - Munjaal: So promise me that much
12/01/2018, 00:42 - Dhaani: If what bothers me?
12/01/2018, 00:42 - Munjaal: Anything
12/01/2018, 00:42 - Dhaani: Baba, I can't promise you that
12/01/2018, 00:43 - Munjaal: Not everything of course. I understand
12/01/2018, 00:43 - Munjaal: But what you can you will
12/01/2018, 00:44 - Dhaani: That I already do na.
12/01/2018, 00:44 - Munjaal: I mean. Don't assume I must be busy or working and avoid
12/01/2018, 00:44 - Dhaani: Haan baba
12/01/2018, 00:45 - Dhaani: I know your priorities
12/01/2018, 00:46 - Munjaal: 👾

12/01/2018, 00:53 - Munjaal: 🤔😓
12/01/2018, 00:53 - Munjaal: Yeah mostly. If work intensity keeps rising like this I might as well end up dead
12/01/2018, 00:54 - Dhaani: Please take care?
12/01/2018, 00:54 - Munjaal: Trying to within limits
12/01/2018, 00:54 - Dhaani: And don't take on more work than is manageable while taking care of yourself, ok?
12/01/2018, 00:55 - Munjaal: Shit is going down faster than I can repair.
12/01/2018, 00:55 - Munjaal: On all ends
12/01/2018, 00:55 - Munjaal: Still I'll give it my best. Don't worry
12/01/2018, 00:55 - Munjaal: 💪🏻😏
12/01/2018, 00:56 - Dhaani: You take care of yourself. The rest of the stuff I don't really care about

12/01/2018, 00:59 - Dhaani: Thoda.

12/01/2018, 01:00 - Munjaal: 😐
12/01/2018, 01:00 - Munjaal: 5 hours isn't enough

27/02/2018, 12:21 - Munjaal: No
27/02/2018, 12:22 - Munjaal: Got the news from panda. He sent 2 messages saying he isn't coming

27/02/2018, 12:22 - Dhaani: Pune?
27/02/2018, 12:23 - Munjaal: Yes
27/02/2018, 12:23 - Dhaani: 😐
27/02/2018, 14:53 - Dhaani: Around people at work. Can't talk but I can text
27/02/2018, 14:58 - Munjaal: That's alright

27/02/2018, 23:57 - Munjaal: I like her
27/02/2018, 23:57 - Dhaani: 😃
27/02/2018, 23:58 - Dhaani: Does she like you?
27/02/2018, 23:58 - Munjaal: I think so
27/02/2018, 23:58 - Dhaani: 🤪
27/02/2018, 23:58 - Munjaal: 😅
27/02/2018, 23:58 - Dhaani: 💃🏽
27/02/2018, 23:59 - Munjaal: But I'm ~a little~ conflicted
27/02/2018, 23:59 - Dhaani: Kyun?
27/02/2018, 23:59 - Munjaal: It's taken me a long while to pull my shields up again.
28/02/2018, 00:00 - Munjaal: All of this seems scary
28/02/2018, 00:00 - Dhaani: I can understand that
28/02/2018, 00:00 - Dhaani: Ok, tell me this. Do you think you know her well enough?
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Munjaal: She's opening up
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Munjaal: We've gone out twice
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Dhaani: Fair enough
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Dhaani: Are you opening up?
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Munjaal: Yeah
28/02/2018, 00:01 - Munjaal: Bit by bit
28/02/2018, 00:02 - Dhaani: Well then, ease yourself into it
28/02/2018, 00:02 - Dhaani: It'll always be scary. Trust me on that.
28/02/2018, 00:03 - Dhaani: You have no idea how terrified I get when I start falling for someone.
28/02/2018, 00:03 - Dhaani: But if it feels like it is worth it, allow yourself to.
28/02/2018, 00:03 - Munjaal: Hmm
28/02/2018, 00:04 - Dhaani: What's bothering you?
28/02/2018, 00:05 - Munjaal: Nothing in particular
28/02/2018, 00:08 - Dhaani: Pakka?
28/02/2018, 00:08 - Munjaal: Yeah
28/02/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: By the way
28/02/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: Parents still insisting you stay home while they travel ?
28/02/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: Not exactly.
28/02/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: But Maani will be in Pune.
28/02/2018, 00:10 - Munjaal: Oh
28/02/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: I was thinking of claiming I was crashing at Rhea's
28/02/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: Now Maani is already claiming that.
28/02/2018, 00:11 - Dhaani: And I don't want to claim we're in the same place because that gets complicated.
28/02/2018, 00:11 - Munjaal: Aah
28/02/2018, 00:11 - Munjaal: That's sad
28/02/2018, 00:11 - Dhaani: Ya
28/02/2018, 00:12 - Dhaani: So let's see if I can think of a solution.
28/02/2018, 00:12 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
28/02/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: 🙈
28/02/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: Don't do this to me!
28/02/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: You know I really want to be there na baba
28/02/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: I miss you!
28/02/2018, 00:13 - Dhaani: And I feel like I haven't been around you while both of us are relatively relaxed in ages!
28/02/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: Yeah ...
28/02/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: I miss you too
28/02/2018, 00:14 - Dhaani: We'll make that happen soon at least.
28/02/2018, 00:15 - Munjaal: Yupp. I can't wait to be done with this stress
28/02/2018, 00:15 - Dhaani: Yessss

28/02/2018, 00:16 - Munjaal: Yupp
28/02/2018, 00:16 - Munjaal: And I want to give you a treat
28/02/2018, 00:16 - Dhaani: Treat for what now?
28/02/2018, 00:17 - Munjaal: Bleh. No reason. Feel like it
28/02/2018, 00:17 - Dhaani: Arre

28/02/2018, 00:21 - Dhaani: Hahaha
28/02/2018, 00:21 - Dhaani: Fair enough

07/03/2018, 00:06 - Munjaal: Oh look. It's the glittery vampire guy
07/03/2018, 00:05 - Dhaani: That identity is probably why he looks so done. He hated that series but it was good money.
07/03/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: 😂😂😂
07/03/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: Probably still regrets it
07/03/2018, 00:10 - Dhaani: Maybe.
07/03/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: Hmm
07/03/2018, 00:14 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>

07/03/2018, 00:12 - Dhaani: 🙄
07/03/2018, 00:15 - Munjaal: 🤷🏻‍♂
07/03/2018, 00:14 - Dhaani: I don't want you to spend two full days on something yaa.
07/03/2018, 00:15 - Dhaani: When you're helping me with the neural networks thing anyway.
07/03/2018, 00:18 - Munjaal: I'm helping because I can and want to
07/03/2018, 00:18 - Munjaal: willingly
07/03/2018, 00:16 - Dhaani: Haan but you know what I mean...
07/03/2018, 00:19 - Munjaal: 🤫
07/03/2018, 00:16 - Dhaani: Also, you know I am a very curious person. 😅
07/03/2018, 00:19 - Munjaal: I ought to apologize for the delay though 😅
07/03/2018, 00:20 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/03/2018, 00:18 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
07/03/2018, 00:18 - Dhaani: You shouldn't apologise!
07/03/2018, 00:22 - Munjaal: But for once I wanted to give it on time and shit went down
07/03/2018, 00:22 - Munjaal: :(
07/03/2018, 00:19 - Dhaani: Happens baba
07/03/2018, 00:25 - Munjaal: I'll try to make up for it by quality 😏😉
07/03/2018, 00:25 - Dhaani: 🙈
07/03/2018, 00:25 - Dhaani: Which means more effort for you.
07/03/2018, 00:25 - Dhaani: You idiot.
07/03/2018, 00:29 - Munjaal: Any effort which goes to something positive is always appreciated
07/03/2018, 00:30 - Munjaal: If it makes you happy (which I hope), I'd have been paid back in full
07/03/2018, 00:30 - Dhaani: You're an absolute sweetheart, you know that?
07/03/2018, 00:34 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
07/03/2018, 00:32 - Dhaani: Hahaha
07/03/2018, 06:54 - Munjaal: You know. I've genuinely never met anyone as strong , unwavering and irreproachable yet as compassionate and caring as you. 
Despite the debilitating and incapacitating experiences you unfortunately had to suffer in the past; of magnitudes that would render most people irreparable, you managed to carve out an exemplary path which no longer holds you back (you proactively don't let it).
Knowing you, you will say that you received aid from quite a few amazing people; but mustering the amount of courage it takes to stand up in spite of the help and support, if any, is no small feat. 
Countless have drawn their strengths from you and I'm no exception to that list.

You keep saying that you got lucky with people, but let me say this..
You are a beautiful person, mind ,body and soul and I genuinely love and respect you for who you are.
Thank you for having found me :') :P

P.S: sorry for the unexpected wall of text
07/03/2018, 07:54 - Dhaani: Ok wow.
07/03/2018, 07:55 - Dhaani: You've sort of left me speechless

07/03/2018, 11:33 - Dhaani: And had disturbed sleep for some reason...
07/03/2018, 11:33 - Dhaani: How much sleep did you get?
07/03/2018, 11:35 - Munjaal: About 5 hours
07/03/2018, 11:36 - Munjaal: But withdrawal makes it difficult
07/03/2018, 11:36 - Munjaal: And I shouldn't take anymore caffeine

14/03/2018, 21:47 - Munjaal: 😓

14/03/2018, 22:31 - Dhaani: 😕
14/03/2018, 22:44 - Munjaal: I'm kidding

14/03/2018, 22:51 - Dhaani: No arguments....
14/03/2018, 22:55 - Munjaal: Umm. The opposite was the issue. I overslept in the night and slept again during the lectures
14/03/2018, 22:52 - Dhaani: 😒
14/03/2018, 22:56 - Munjaal: Umm
14/03/2018, 22:54 - Dhaani: What time did you sleep last night?
14/03/2018, 22:54 - Dhaani: And what time did you wake up?
14/03/2018, 22:58 - Munjaal: Maybe my body's way of telling me "go grab that blue can"
14/03/2018, 22:58 - Munjaal: Slept around 12:15 I think. Woke up at 7:30
14/03/2018, 22:56 - Dhaani: 12:45 you were still texting me, when I decided to sleep.
14/03/2018, 23:00 - Munjaal: Must be around 1 then.
14/03/2018, 23:00 - Munjaal: But me got 6 hours at least me thinks
14/03/2018, 22:57 - Dhaani: Ya, which is nowhere near oversleeping.
14/03/2018, 23:01 - Munjaal: +2 in the lectures 😅
14/03/2018, 23:00 - Dhaani: No, that doesn't count.
14/03/2018, 23:00 - Dhaani: You haven't gotten a proper night's sleep in ages, have you?
14/03/2018, 23:00 - Dhaani: With the way you normally function, I mean 9+ straight hours.

14/03/2018, 23:07 - Dhaani: Wear them?
14/03/2018, 23:10 - Munjaal: But I'm sort of stuck in an awkward position
14/03/2018, 23:07 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
14/03/2018, 23:11 - Munjaal: Friend of mine decided to come over, we were installing something on his laptop
14/03/2018, 23:11 - Munjaal: He was sleepy and decided my leg was a better pillow
14/03/2018, 23:12 - Munjaal: I can't move and my leg is dead
14/03/2018, 23:08 - Dhaani: 😒
14/03/2018, 23:12 - Munjaal: 🤷🏻‍♂

16/03/2018, 01:21 - Munjaal: So I was like that for a good minute or two
16/03/2018, 01:18 - Dhaani: 😒
16/03/2018, 01:21 - Munjaal: Me neither but I used to replace cardio with swimming so had to be aggressive
16/03/2018, 01:21 - Dhaani: I don't think I am allowed to be aggressive anyway. 😅
16/03/2018, 01:24 - Munjaal: Yeah you better don't even try
16/03/2018, 01:22 - Dhaani: Haan. I won't.

19/03/2018, 21:04 - Munjaal: Sorry

19/03/2018, 22:51 - Munjaal: Rofl
19/03/2018, 22:52 - Munjaal: That's how people look in the IR spectrum
19/03/2018, 22:56 - Dhaani: Which is fine
19/03/2018, 22:56 - Dhaani: I am more curious about why that is your profile picture

19/03/2018, 23:26 - Dhaani: Haan, I got that.
19/03/2018, 23:28 - Munjaal: Drunk on boredom
19/03/2018, 23:27 - Dhaani: Me tired.
19/03/2018, 23:30 - Munjaal: Sleepy?
19/03/2018, 23:29 - Dhaani: Not sleepy. Just thoda tired.
19/03/2018, 23:29 - Dhaani: And have VJTI tomorrow. Invigilation duty.
19/03/2018, 23:30 - Dhaani: I'd normally take Uberpool in the morning but apparently there is a strike.
19/03/2018, 23:30 - Dhaani: So I'll leave thoda early.
19/03/2018, 23:32 - Munjaal: Yeah
19/03/2018, 23:30 - Dhaani: And take a train
19/03/2018, 23:30 - Munjaal: It's gonna be crammed
19/03/2018, 23:31 - Dhaani: Not if I get to the station before 8.
19/03/2018, 23:31 - Dhaani: Or around 8.
19/03/2018, 23:31 - Dhaani: And take an Andheri starting train.
19/03/2018, 23:31 - Munjaal: Hmm. That means getting up at 6
19/03/2018, 23:32 - Dhaani: Though I need to check which platform those are on. I think that's changed. 😅
19/03/2018, 23:32 - Dhaani: 6:30.
19/03/2018, 23:32 - Munjaal: Andheri to Matunga Road na ?
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Munjaal: Platform 4
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Dhaani: Yup.
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Dhaani: Thanks!
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Munjaal: What are you doing ??
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Dhaani: Tomorrow will be a relatively long day.
19/03/2018, 23:33 - Dhaani: Just getting comfortable. You?
19/03/2018, 23:34 - Munjaal: Lying in bed
19/03/2018, 23:34 - Munjaal: Can't sledp
19/03/2018, 23:35 - Dhaani: Why not?
19/03/2018, 23:35 - Munjaal: Slept for 3 hours in the evening
19/03/2018, 23:36 - Dhaani: Ohh
19/03/2018, 23:36 - Dhaani: I am thoda tired. Had nightmares last night.
19/03/2018, 23:37 - Munjaal: :/
19/03/2018, 23:37 - Munjaal: Kya hua ?
19/03/2018, 23:38 - Dhaani: Kuch nahi hua. Just had nightmares so didn't feel as rested.
19/03/2018, 23:38 - Munjaal: Teeth ?
19/03/2018, 23:40 - Dhaani: No.
19/03/2018, 23:40 - Dhaani: Sexual assault by a friend.
19/03/2018, 23:41 - Dhaani: It's fine though. Didn't really mess with my head.
19/03/2018, 23:41 - Dhaani: Just left me thoda sleep deprived.
19/03/2018, 23:41 - Munjaal: 😕
19/03/2018, 23:42 - Dhaani: Sorry.
19/03/2018, 23:42 - Dhaani: You didn't need to know that.
19/03/2018, 23:42 - Munjaal: Why are you apologizing for that.
19/03/2018, 23:42 - Dhaani: I promise though, I genuinely wasn't disturbed...
19/03/2018, 23:43 - Dhaani: So you shouldn't worry either.
19/03/2018, 23:43 - Munjaal: Alright
19/03/2018, 23:43 - Munjaal: You could use a dreamcatcher :p
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Dhaani: I have one.
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Dhaani: Maani gifted it to me.
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Munjaal: It ran out of fantasy batteries
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Dhaani: 😅
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Munjaal: Oh wait
19/03/2018, 23:44 - Munjaal: That explains it
19/03/2018, 23:48 - Dhaani: Hahaha
19/03/2018, 23:48 - Munjaal: :p
19/03/2018, 23:49 - Dhaani: How was your day?
19/03/2018, 23:50 - Munjaal: :'( why you gotta make me cry
19/03/2018, 23:51 - Dhaani: Arre re
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Dhaani: Aisa Kya hua?
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Munjaal: Exam
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Dhaani: Exam?
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Munjaal: Depressing
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Munjaal: M2
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Dhaani: Wait, when did M2 start?
19/03/2018, 23:52 - Dhaani: Till when is it?
19/03/2018, 23:53 - Munjaal: 🤐oops
19/03/2018, 23:54 - Dhaani: Tell me.
19/03/2018, 23:55 - Munjaal: Such wonderful weather na 😬
19/03/2018, 23:55 - Munjaal: The summer's dying out
19/03/2018, 23:55 - Dhaani: 😒
19/03/2018, 23:55 - Dhaani: Munjaal
19/03/2018, 23:56 - Munjaal: Till 24 😪
19/03/2018, 23:57 - Dhaani: Right. Why didn't you tell me?
19/03/2018, 23:57 - Dhaani: And do you have a paper tomorrow?
19/03/2018, 23:57 - Munjaal: Everyday till Saturday
19/03/2018, 23:58 - Dhaani: Prepared?
19/03/2018, 23:58 - Munjaal: More or less
19/03/2018, 23:58 - Munjaal: It's M2 after all, 3 hours in the morning is more than enough
20/03/2018, 00:02 - Dhaani: Just study for these, alright
20/03/2018, 00:02 - Dhaani: Anyway, me sleep now.
20/03/2018, 00:03 - Munjaal: Don't worry I will 😁
20/03/2018, 00:03 - Munjaal: Yupp. Goodnight Sweet Dreams, Take Care

P.S: You're wonderful
20/03/2018, 00:04 - Dhaani: ☺
20/03/2018, 00:04 - Dhaani: Good night 
Sweet dreams 
Take care 
Sleep with a smile! 
All the best for tomorrow
20/03/2018, 00:05 - Dhaani: And thank you... You're pretty amazing yourself...
20/03/2018, 16:31 - Dhaani: My Visa application was denied.
20/03/2018, 18:30 - Munjaal: Apply for remonstration right away
20/03/2018, 18:30 - Dhaani: Still won't come in in time
20/03/2018, 18:31 - Munjaal: No harm in applying. It's free. Plus at times they respond in time
20/03/2018, 21:57 - Munjaal: Please take care.
20/03/2018, 22:01 - Dhaani: Baba, I am fine.
20/03/2018, 23:13 - Dhaani: Mum is refusing trip in India
20/03/2018, 23:13 - Dhaani: Telling me to simply take my trip once I land a job.
20/03/2018, 23:14 - Munjaal: 😕
20/03/2018, 23:15 - Munjaal: How did this happen all of a sudden ?
20/03/2018, 23:16 - Munjaal: and won't it be more difficult to do that ?
20/03/2018, 23:16 - Dhaani: Nope. Because then i can show that I have a job to come back to.
20/03/2018, 23:16 - Dhaani: My tickets are valid till the end of September.
20/03/2018, 23:17 - Munjaal: Any set of holidays coming in between that you can use ?
20/03/2018, 23:17 - Dhaani: Or mum is telling me to drag Pearl or Vasu along to some random place close by that she deems safe. 
As if they're just sitting around waiting for me to make travel plans with them.
20/03/2018, 23:18 - Munjaal: Hmm
20/03/2018, 23:18 - Munjaal: You could ask pearl na ? If she's not busy studying
20/03/2018, 23:18 - Dhaani: She is studying.
20/03/2018, 23:19 - Dhaani: And a trip is also an expenditure.
20/03/2018, 23:19 - Dhaani: I've been planning for it.
20/03/2018, 23:19 - Dhaani: I can't ask anyone else to impulsively splurge na.
20/03/2018, 23:19 - Dhaani: And anyway, at this point, bookings for next weekend are going to be difficult and pricey
20/03/2018, 23:20 - Munjaal: Hmm
20/03/2018, 23:20 - Munjaal: Yeah there's that
20/03/2018, 23:20 - Dhaani: Yup.
20/03/2018, 23:20 - Munjaal: Oh about the call.
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Munjaal: I'm sorry I had a splitting headache. Couldn't talk properly
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Dhaani: Wait, what?
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Munjaal: *had..
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Dhaani: Why do you have a splitting headache?
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Munjaal: No idea. Woke up to it
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Dhaani: Is it gone?
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Munjaal: Took meds . Gone
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Munjaal: Don't worry
20/03/2018, 23:21 - Dhaani: Have you had enough water?
20/03/2018, 23:22 - Munjaal: Apparently i think not. Drank about an entire jar
20/03/2018, 23:22 - Munjaal: Dunno how I managed. Wasn't even feeling thirsty 😅
20/03/2018, 23:22 - Munjaal: Meh nvm that
20/03/2018, 23:23 - Munjaal: Would a Lonavala level trip be a good balance of chill, not too far, solo time and no issues with parents ?
20/03/2018, 23:23 - Dhaani: I don't know.
20/03/2018, 23:23 - Dhaani: I don't understand their concept of safett
20/03/2018, 23:24 - Munjaal: Or would that require you to visit your grandfather at Pune ?
20/03/2018, 23:23 - Dhaani: *safety
20/03/2018, 23:25 - Dhaani: I am half tempted to remind them that I've been rather unsafe even in this home
20/03/2018, 23:25 - Munjaal: ..
20/03/2018, 23:26 - Munjaal: I don't think you should step on that landmine
20/03/2018, 23:25 - Dhaani: Sorry.
20/03/2018, 23:26 - Dhaani: Just venting
20/03/2018, 23:26 - Munjaal: It's alright
20/03/2018, 23:26 - Dhaani: Won't do something like that.
20/03/2018, 23:26 - Dhaani: I am tired. That's all.
20/03/2018, 23:27 - Munjaal: You don't need to apologize for all this. I can understand this much
20/03/2018, 23:27 - Munjaal: Idiot
20/03/2018, 23:27 - Munjaal: P.S: I'm a decent pseudo punching bag if physical venting helps :p
20/03/2018, 23:28 - Dhaani: No. You don't get punched for things that aren't your fault.
20/03/2018, 23:28 - Munjaal: I'm strong enough to take quite a few punches without any issue 😒
20/03/2018, 23:29 - Munjaal: *quite* a few
20/03/2018, 23:29 - Munjaal: Plus don't I have a few pending ones already :p
20/03/2018, 23:30 - Dhaani: I don't care.
20/03/2018, 23:30 - Dhaani: You're not going to be my punching bag.
20/03/2018, 23:31 - Munjaal: 🤔
20/03/2018, 23:32 - Munjaal: Ah.  the option for Mathura is still there na ? Doesn't that perfectly fit all categories ?
20/03/2018, 23:32 - Dhaani: Mathura means visiting family.
20/03/2018, 23:32 - Dhaani: I don't want that right now.
20/03/2018, 23:33 - Munjaal: Hmm
20/03/2018, 23:34 - Dhaani: I just feel like disappearing on the world.
20/03/2018, 23:35 - Munjaal: Yeah you do that and you'll learn that I'm a fairly decent tracker
20/03/2018, 23:36 - Munjaal: And I'm not the only one in your friend circle who's capable. I'm sure there are far more efficient ones
20/03/2018, 23:36 - Dhaani: Capable, perhaps.
20/03/2018, 23:37 - Dhaani: Inclined, I wouldn't be so sure.
20/03/2018, 23:37 - Munjaal: 🤨 really ?
20/03/2018, 23:38 - Dhaani: Ya.
20/03/2018, 23:38 - Munjaal: I know them through you but I'm sure that the ones who are inclined are more than enough to find and convince the capable ones
20/03/2018, 23:38 - Dhaani: I am a habit but a pretty easy habit to break, it seems.
20/03/2018, 23:42 - Munjaal: Either Bad or small sample space
20/03/2018, 23:44 - Dhaani: I am not someone people actively miss. I am a phase and then a passing thought, once maybe in a few months. 
A chapter in their stories. A chapter of transition. But transition is momentary.
20/03/2018, 23:48 - Munjaal: You show people who they are. The good and the bad. If they choose to stay away, don't you think that they haven't yet come to terms with themselves.
20/03/2018, 23:48 - Munjaal: Beyond that, even one strong example against a any theory is strong enough to disqualify it, here there are surplus
20/03/2018, 23:49 - Munjaal: If not disqualify, does at least put it in question
20/03/2018, 23:51 - Dhaani: Someone I counted as my closest friend didn't even hesitate before walking away.
20/03/2018, 23:52 - Dhaani: And he isn't the first person to fade.
20/03/2018, 23:54 - Munjaal: He will realise his mistake in time
20/03/2018, 23:54 - Munjaal: It does hurt though I know.
20/03/2018, 23:55 - Dhaani: No. You don't know how many have disappeared on me.
20/03/2018, 23:57 - Munjaal: Disappeared or actively cut ties ?
20/03/2018, 23:58 - Dhaani: What's the difference?
21/03/2018, 00:00 - Munjaal: Well disappeared could mean that they have slowly drifted out of contact due to lack of interaction fuelled by distance or work or circumstance. No bad blood.
This person is the latter
21/03/2018, 00:00 - Dhaani: What about people who don't return my calls?
21/03/2018, 00:01 - Munjaal: Umm
Can I ask a question ?
21/03/2018, 00:02 - Dhaani: Ask.
21/03/2018, 00:03 - Munjaal: Shaurya isn't doing anything similar na ?
21/03/2018, 00:03 - Dhaani: Sometimes.
21/03/2018, 00:03 - Dhaani: That's the thing. I am pretty easy to take for granted.
21/03/2018, 00:03 - Dhaani: Dependable, they call it.
21/03/2018, 00:03 - Munjaal: No. I'll tell you something he told me
21/03/2018, 00:04 - Munjaal: He's not avoiding you, or me
21/03/2018, 00:05 - Munjaal: But he doesn't know how to talk to either of us knowing he's done the same thing that we don't like seeing him do.
Breaks him a little.
Told this to me himself.
He can't talk to us eye to eye
21/03/2018, 00:06 - Munjaal: If it's him I can assure you he's not avoiding us
21/03/2018, 00:06 - Dhaani: People don't avoid me. They forget me.
21/03/2018, 00:09 - Munjaal: May I give you a call ?
21/03/2018, 00:12 - Dhaani: Give me a few minutes?
21/03/2018, 00:13 - Munjaal: Aye aye
21/03/2018, 01:29 - Dhaani: https://youtu.be/yHrPc-fJXSg
21/03/2018, 09:51 - Munjaal: Good Morning 

Hope you have a wonderful day ahead
21/03/2018, 10:24 - Dhaani: Good morning
21/03/2018, 10:32 - Dhaani: I am considering not going to work today.
21/03/2018, 10:50 - Munjaal: Do that
21/03/2018, 10:50 - Munjaal: A break is necessary
21/03/2018, 11:27 - Dhaani: Doing that.
21/03/2018, 11:31 - Munjaal: gonna be at home ?
21/03/2018, 11:31 - Dhaani: That, I haven't decided.
21/03/2018, 11:32 - Munjaal: hmm , ok
21/03/2018, 16:05 - Dhaani: How was the test?
21/03/2018, 16:09 - Munjaal: 12+ 😁
21/03/2018, 16:13 - Munjaal: Where are you ?
21/03/2018, 16:12 - Dhaani: Home. About to leave
21/03/2018, 16:17 - Munjaal: Okay
21/03/2018, 17:15 - Munjaal: Are we meeting today ?
21/03/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: Honestly, seems difficult.
21/03/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: 🙈
21/03/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: I am still home.
21/03/2018, 17:33 - Dhaani: Have to go visit someone in the hospital in a but.
21/03/2018, 17:33 - Dhaani: *bit
21/03/2018, 17:37 - Munjaal: Hey. It's alright
21/03/2018, 17:37 - Munjaal: I'm still around if you have time later. Otherwise we can meet some other day as well
21/03/2018, 17:35 - Dhaani: I'll see you tomorrow?
21/03/2018, 17:38 - Munjaal: Okay
22/03/2018, 01:13 - Munjaal: I'm not feeling bad :P
22/03/2018, 01:15 - Dhaani: Ok
22/03/2018, 01:27 - Munjaal: 🤨
22/03/2018, 01:27 - Dhaani: What?
22/03/2018, 01:27 - Munjaal: Kuch nahi
22/03/2018, 01:29 - Dhaani: 😁
22/03/2018, 01:58 - Munjaal: I miss you
22/03/2018, 01:58 - Dhaani: I miss you too
22/03/2018, 01:59 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/03/2018, 01:59 - Dhaani: What is that expression?
22/03/2018, 01:59 - Dhaani: 😅
22/03/2018, 02:00 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/03/2018, 02:03 - Dhaani: Awww
22/03/2018, 02:03 - Munjaal: 😛
22/03/2018, 02:03 - Munjaal: Sushi dog

26/03/2018, 00:44 - Dhaani: No major ones.
26/03/2018, 00:44 - Dhaani: Came very close to making a big mess though
26/03/2018, 00:45 - Munjaal: :/
26/03/2018, 00:46 - Munjaal: You could tell me. If it's alright.
26/03/2018, 00:52 - Dhaani: I will
26/03/2018, 00:52 - Dhaani: Don't feel like typing so much.

26/03/2018, 00:55 - Dhaani: 🙈
26/03/2018, 00:56 - Dhaani: Tell me
26/03/2018, 00:56 - Dhaani: This
26/03/2018, 00:56 - Munjaal: Hmm
26/03/2018, 00:59 - Munjaal: In brief. Dad had made dinner for them. A dish that one of em likes. Being the host we sort of have this rule where we won't have food before them. I reminded them multiple times about dinner being ready and had to tell them that my parents are waiting as well.
26/03/2018, 01:00 - Munjaal: They were busy in some stupid mobile game of theirs
26/03/2018, 01:00 - Munjaal: Parents had food at 1:30 in the night that day
26/03/2018, 01:02 - Munjaal: Now it's not as bad but I don't like that and add to the fact late dinners have issues health wise for them. Well.. Yeah
26/03/2018, 01:05 - Dhaani: No, 1:30 for parents is ridiculous!
26/03/2018, 01:05 - Dhaani: And if someone's parents are waiting for dinner, you have dinner first. It's basic understanding
26/03/2018, 01:06 - Munjaal: 🤷🏻‍♂
26/03/2018, 01:12 - Munjaal: They don't mind it cause they understand we get carried away and all. But I don't like it
26/03/2018, 01:12 - Munjaal: Meh. Happened
26/03/2018, 01:12 - Dhaani: Hmmm
26/03/2018, 01:13 - Munjaal: What are you gonna be up to ?
26/03/2018, 01:15 - Dhaani: ?
26/03/2018, 01:16 - Munjaal: I mean. Work, plans

16/04/2018, 23:37 - Munjaal: ohkay
16/04/2018, 23:37 - Dhaani: Unfortunately
16/04/2018, 23:37 - Dhaani: Otherwise it'll get overwritten.

18/04/2018, 08:55 - Munjaal: Oh
18/04/2018, 08:55 - Dhaani: So it was hot. She feels really cold too easily.
18/04/2018, 08:55 - Dhaani: And she was snoring.
18/04/2018, 08:55 - Munjaal: Aah.
18/04/2018, 08:55 - Dhaani: Yup.
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Munjaal: Not the best thing when you're exhausted
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Munjaal: After a hectic day eh
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Dhaani: And every 15 minutes, she was using the mosquito thingy around my head.
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Dhaani: Not the best sound near your ears.
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Munjaal: The spray ? ....
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Munjaal: Or racket
18/04/2018, 08:56 - Dhaani: Yup.
18/04/2018, 08:57 - Munjaal: 😓
18/04/2018, 08:57 - Munjaal: You need chai
18/04/2018, 08:57 - Munjaal: 😬
18/04/2018, 08:58 - Dhaani: Desperately.
18/04/2018, 08:58 - Munjaal: Left from home na ?
18/04/2018, 08:58 - Dhaani: I am taking two more readings now.
18/04/2018, 08:58 - Dhaani: Then I'll go to work. Drop of the machine and leave, hopefully.
18/04/2018, 08:59 - Munjaal: Hopefully
18/04/2018, 08:59 - Munjaal: 🤞🏻
18/04/2018, 09:02 - Dhaani: Yup.

18/04/2018, 11:18 - Dhaani: Yup
18/04/2018, 11:18 - Dhaani: I realized they've covered all USB ports to the laptop
18/04/2018, 11:18 - Dhaani: So on my way to office.
18/04/2018, 11:18 - Dhaani: Will open the box, copy data, return everything
18/04/2018, 11:19 - Dhaani: And hopefully leave
18/04/2018, 11:30 - Munjaal: Ooh
18/04/2018, 11:30 - Munjaal: Mail the data to yourself using mobile hotspot or any WiFi
18/04/2018, 11:30 - Dhaani: I have to go to office to return the module anyway na
18/04/2018, 11:31 - Munjaal: Haan but don't open it na
18/04/2018, 11:31 - Munjaal: You can transfer the data without that risk
18/04/2018, 11:31 - Dhaani: I'll let sir decide how to transfer data
18/04/2018, 11:32 - Munjaal: Yeah. That'll be safer
18/04/2018, 11:40 - Dhaani: Yup
18/04/2018, 17:57 - Munjaal: 🐱
18/04/2018, 21:31 - Munjaal: Oii
18/04/2018, 21:33 - Dhaani: Hi
18/04/2018, 22:09 - Munjaal: What's up ?
18/04/2018, 22:09 - Dhaani: Not much really
18/04/2018, 22:09 - Dhaani: You tell me.
18/04/2018, 22:10 - Munjaal: I'm good
18/04/2018, 22:10 - Munjaal: Everything alright ?
18/04/2018, 22:10 - Munjaal: Doesn't seem so
18/04/2018, 22:22 - Dhaani: Everything is fine baba
18/04/2018, 22:22 - Dhaani: I've just been thoda caught up and tired today.
18/04/2018, 22:22 - Dhaani: I did come home early and take a nap.
18/04/2018, 22:28 - Munjaal: Ah! 😅
18/04/2018, 22:29 - Munjaal: Umm, can you send me the files if you're free ?
18/04/2018, 22:30 - Dhaani: I added them to the driv3.
18/04/2018, 22:31 - Dhaani: *drive
18/04/2018, 22:34 - Munjaal: Ok 👍🏻
18/04/2018, 22:55 - Dhaani: Please tell me you took care of your submissions?
18/04/2018, 22:56 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
19/04/2018, 02:31 - Munjaal: The data is 5.6 seconds per person
19/04/2018, 02:31 - Munjaal: 2800 data points at 500Hz
19/04/2018, 02:31 - Munjaal: Not 30
19/04/2018, 06:36 - Dhaani: 😕
19/04/2018, 06:37 - Dhaani: We don't have enough data now, do we?
19/04/2018, 09:34 - Munjaal: Let's see. Lemme think of something
19/04/2018, 09:48 - Dhaani: 😔
19/04/2018, 10:31 - Munjaal: Oi , nothing has gone to the drain yet. Just means the model will have to be more carefully built.
19/04/2018, 10:32 - Munjaal: More practice for me 😁
19/04/2018, 10:32 - Munjaal: Put up a smile now. Don't make me parcel a chai
19/04/2018, 11:31 - Dhaani: 😅
19/04/2018, 13:14 - Munjaal: How's your day like today ?
19/04/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: No idea
19/04/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: A company coming in for placements
19/04/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: The seminar ended almost half an hour back.
19/04/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: We're supposed to have an aptitude test now.
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Dhaani: And then, interviews for shortlisted candidates.
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Munjaal: Ah all the best !!
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Dhaani: Then I have to go with the other interns to buy a gift because someone from office is getting married tomorrow and we have to attend. 😓
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Dhaani: Thank you!
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Dhaani: What's your day like?
19/04/2018, 13:19 - Munjaal: 1 exam
19/04/2018, 13:19 - Munjaal: That's it
19/04/2018, 13:19 - Dhaani: Exam?
19/04/2018, 13:19 - Munjaal: M3

19/04/2018, 13:23 - Dhaani: All the best!
19/04/2018, 13:29 - Munjaal: Bahh

19/04/2018, 17:39 - Dhaani: I miss you too baba
20/04/2018, 17:10 - Munjaal: Hey, how was it ?
20/04/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: Not good.
20/04/2018, 17:33 - Munjaal: ..
20/04/2018, 17:33 - Munjaal: Where are you ??
20/04/2018, 17:35 - Dhaani: Just stepped out of college.
20/04/2018, 17:36 - Munjaal: Ohkay
20/04/2018, 17:36 - Dhaani: Where are you?
20/04/2018, 17:37 - Munjaal: College
20/04/2018, 17:37 - Munjaal: I'm done though
20/04/2018, 17:38 - Dhaani: Stay there?
20/04/2018, 17:39 - Munjaal: Yeah
20/04/2018, 17:39 - Munjaal: Don't worry, not doing anything stupid
20/04/2018, 17:39 - Dhaani: Good.
20/04/2018, 22:03 - Munjaal: Are you gonna display the project on your laptop ?
20/04/2018, 22:03 - Munjaal: I mean execute and show
20/04/2018, 22:07 - Dhaani: Maybe. Why?
20/04/2018, 22:09 - Munjaal: Umm
Would you mind using mine instead ? If possible
20/04/2018, 22:30 - Dhaani: Sure
20/04/2018, 22:33 - Munjaal: 👍🏻
21/04/2018, 11:17 - Munjaal: Pune up ?
21/04/2018, 11:50 - Dhaani: Pune postponed
21/04/2018, 11:50 - Munjaal: :/
21/04/2018, 11:51 - Munjaal: okay
21/04/2018, 11:51 - Munjaal: please tell me you didn't postpone it because of project work
21/04/2018, 12:30 - Dhaani: Nahi
22/04/2018, 01:35 - Munjaal: hey, you up ?
22/04/2018, 01:35 - Dhaani: Yes
22/04/2018, 01:35 - Dhaani: Hi
22/04/2018, 01:35 - Munjaal: some discrepancy in the data here
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Munjaal: how sleepy are you at the moment ?
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Dhaani: Tell me
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Dhaani: Arre it's fine. Tell me
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Munjaal: can i call ?
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Dhaani: Nahi. Can't take calls
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Dhaani: But I can text
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Munjaal: alright
22/04/2018, 01:36 - Munjaal: wait
22/04/2018, 01:39 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/04/2018, 01:39 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/04/2018, 01:39 - Munjaal: something's off
22/04/2018, 01:40 - Dhaani: What are the F0 like for both?
22/04/2018, 01:40 - Munjaal: sending wait
22/04/2018, 01:41 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/04/2018, 01:41 - Dhaani: Check amplitudes for both?
22/04/2018, 01:41 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
22/04/2018, 01:43 - Munjaal: both f0s are flatlines
22/04/2018, 01:43 - Dhaani: Then it's proper data
22/04/2018, 01:44 - Munjaal: but their F1 is opposite
22/04/2018, 01:44 - Dhaani: I know.
22/04/2018, 01:45 - Dhaani: Things get thoda random sometimes.
22/04/2018, 01:45 - Dhaani: Which is why we focus on the most dependable aspect to identify.
22/04/2018, 01:45 - Dhaani: In this case, it's the flatline.
22/04/2018, 01:45 - Munjaal: how occupied are you tomorrow ?
22/04/2018, 01:46 - Dhaani: Not very.
22/04/2018, 01:46 - Munjaal: had an epiphany of sorts
22/04/2018, 01:46 - Munjaal: found a way to handle this data making it simpler to analyze
22/04/2018, 01:47 - Dhaani: ???
22/04/2018, 01:47 - Munjaal: a multi-channel (8 channel) array handling all the graphs in individually
22/04/2018, 01:47 - Munjaal: then you can apply an N x N x 8 dimensional filter
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Munjaal: eases up things
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Dhaani: Kya?
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Dhaani: 8 channel?
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Munjaal: but I'll need to discus these data discrepancies with you
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Munjaal: a normal image has 4 channels , RGB
22/04/2018, 01:48 - Munjaal: *3
22/04/2018, 01:49 - Munjaal: 1 2D array is only Red channel info , like wise 1 for blue and 2 for green
22/04/2018, 01:49 - Munjaal: these will be 8 2D arrays each holding the values of the graph superimposed
22/04/2018, 01:49 - Dhaani: Explain over the phone tomorrow?
22/04/2018, 01:49 - Munjaal: superimposed by position
22/04/2018, 01:49 - Munjaal: alright
22/04/2018, 01:50 - Munjaal: last question :P, I'll let you sleep after that
22/04/2018, 01:50 - Munjaal: do I ignore that above case or consider it :?
22/04/2018, 01:51 - Dhaani: Consider it, I think.
22/04/2018, 01:51 - Dhaani: Cases like that are why we wanted to get real samples na
22/04/2018, 01:51 - Munjaal: hmm , okay
22/04/2018, 01:51 - Munjaal: Alright ! Goodnight , shoo shoo
22/04/2018, 02:02 - Dhaani: 🙈
22/04/2018, 02:03 - Dhaani: You should sleep too
22/04/2018, 02:03 - Munjaal: nope :P
22/04/2018, 02:03 - Munjaal: me working
22/04/2018, 02:03 - Dhaani: Sleep important.
22/04/2018, 02:04 - Munjaal: me sleeps much after work done
22/04/2018, 02:05 - Dhaani: 🙈
22/04/2018, 02:27 - Munjaal: why you up though ?
22/04/2018, 02:39 - Dhaani: Dozing in and out
22/04/2018, 02:39 - Munjaal: hmmm
22/04/2018, 02:43 - Munjaal: wish me could talk to you :P 😈

07/05/2018, 18:15 - Dhaani: As in, the interview with the first person went well.
07/05/2018, 18:15 - Dhaani: The second one, not so much.
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Munjaal: :/
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Munjaal: Okay ..
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Dhaani: He kept fixating on how I don't have any experience in robotics. As though they didn't know that already.
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Munjaal: Well. You could've mentioned Robocon
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Dhaani: Then they told me on the spot that they won't be hiring me but would I be interested in an internship. Which I obviously refused.
07/05/2018, 18:16 - Dhaani: Baba, that guy wanted details.
07/05/2018, 18:17 - Dhaani: Like Arduino code for steering and such.
07/05/2018, 18:17 - Munjaal: Ah well.
07/05/2018, 18:17 - Munjaal: Shit happens I guess

07/05/2018, 18:19 - Dhaani: They're looking for someone for neural networks and fuzzy logic.
07/05/2018, 18:19 - Munjaal: Well. To be honest it doesn't sound very interesting
07/05/2018, 18:19 - Munjaal: This part
07/05/2018, 18:20 - Dhaani: They intend on extracting water from the air.
07/05/2018, 18:20 - Munjaal: 😪 ah well. Okay

27/05/2018, 17:10 - Munjaal: A thread referring to pushing 2d arrays via pointers
27/05/2018, 17:15 - Dhaani: I did come across this thread but couldn't make sense of it.
27/05/2018, 17:18 - Munjaal: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3911400/how-to-pass-2d-array-matrix-in-a-function-in-c
27/05/2018, 17:18 - Munjaal: Method 2 of this
27/05/2018, 17:21 - Dhaani: Within the code, it is treating it the same as an array, isn't it?
27/05/2018, 17:22 - Munjaal: Yes but the allocation is dynamic using malloc with sizeof
27/05/2018, 17:22 - Munjaal: Check the main function of the same
27/05/2018, 17:22 - Dhaani: But I don't have to write the main function. I just have to complete the function within the brackets.
27/05/2018, 17:22 - Munjaal: For testing
27/05/2018, 17:23 - Dhaani: That's why no creating functions na
27/05/2018, 17:23 - Dhaani: Aah, yes.
27/05/2018, 17:26 - Dhaani: 🙈
27/05/2018, 17:26 - Dhaani: Not making sense to me.
27/05/2018, 17:27 - Dhaani: Can I send my function to you?

11/12/2018, 13:02 - Dhaani: 😊
21/12/2018, 05:06 - Munjaal: When you casually light a mosquito paper and almost fail to notice your bed catching fire ....
21/12/2018, 12:09 - Dhaani: What?!
21/12/2018, 12:23 - Munjaal: What?
21/12/2018, 12:51 - Dhaani: Bed catching fire?
21/12/2018, 16:22 - Munjaal: Aye

24/12/2018, 12:49 - Munjaal: Wanted to talk
24/12/2018, 12:49 - Munjaal: Brain went "no can do"
24/12/2018, 12:56 - Dhaani: It's ok baba
24/12/2018, 12:56 - Dhaani: But I just couldn't call at the time
24/12/2018, 12:57 - Munjaal: Aree
24/12/2018, 12:57 - Munjaal: I couldn't text either
24/12/2018, 13:06 - Dhaani: Theek hai
24/12/2018, 13:13 - Munjaal: I need some help...
24/12/2018, 13:13 - Munjaal: When you're free
24/12/2018, 13:13 - Dhaani: Tell me
24/12/2018, 13:14 - Munjaal: Haven't been able to go to college
24/12/2018, 13:14 - Munjaal: Or get out of bed
24/12/2018, 13:14 - Munjaal: 😕
24/12/2018, 13:14 - Munjaal: Been sleeping for 12 or more hours on average
24/12/2018, 13:17 - Munjaal: P.S: caffeine ain't helping
24/12/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: Get off caffeine, please
24/12/2018, 13:17 - Munjaal: Not on it
24/12/2018, 13:17 - Dhaani: ??
24/12/2018, 13:18 - Munjaal: But I tried these days to see if it'd help
24/12/2018, 13:18 - Munjaal: Yeah
24/12/2018, 13:24 - Dhaani: Yaar, I don't know what to say
24/12/2018, 13:24 - Dhaani: Has the team pressure eased up at all?
24/12/2018, 13:25 - Munjaal: Yeah
24/12/2018, 13:25 - Munjaal: A lot
24/12/2018, 13:47 - Dhaani: That's good!
24/12/2018, 16:31 - Dhaani: Oi

24/12/2018, 16:31 - Dhaani: *?
24/12/2018, 17:06 - Munjaal: Yea
24/12/2018, 18:03 - Munjaal: Why ?
24/12/2018, 19:17 - Dhaani: Call me as soon as you're done with your shower
24/12/2018, 19:18 - Munjaal: ok
24/12/2018, 19:18 - Dhaani: How long will you take?
24/12/2018, 19:18 - Munjaal: 10 mins I think
24/12/2018, 19:18 - Dhaani: Alright.
25/12/2018, 01:30 - Munjaal: Umm
25/12/2018, 01:30 - Munjaal: there ?
25/12/2018, 01:30 - Dhaani: Yup
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: They're symptoms of stroke
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: Just asked Riddhi
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: Please get to a doctor
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Dhaani: 😕
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Dhaani: I had a stroke?
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: yes
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: There are chances
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Dhaani: Which symptoms?
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Dhaani: The shaking?
25/12/2018, 01:31 - Munjaal: The symptoms are matching
25/12/2018, 01:32 - Munjaal: you couldn't feel half your face as well right ?
25/12/2018, 01:32 - Dhaani: Or the numbness that was a week earlier?
25/12/2018, 01:32 - Munjaal: see it usually doesn't happen to youngsters so it could be something else (for the better)
25/12/2018, 01:32 - Dhaani: I could sort of feel it but my lip was pulling down on one side and twitching weirdly.
25/12/2018, 01:33 - Dhaani: Could the bav have anything to do with that? 
And having high bp and heart rate spikes on and off for two years now?
25/12/2018, 01:33 - Munjaal: how high was your BP ?
25/12/2018, 01:35 - Dhaani: I don't know. I told you, they measured it while I was standing, which apparently isn't an accurate reading
25/12/2018, 01:36 - Dhaani: But the reading wasn't that high. 140/95
25/12/2018, 01:36 - Munjaal: How long has this been happening ?
25/12/2018, 01:37 - Munjaal: and any other symptoms ? like chest pain or something ?
25/12/2018, 01:37 - Dhaani: The first time was just numbness in left arm and leg, with patches of pain down one line along each, for about a day. That was more than 3 weeks back, I think. Maybe less.
25/12/2018, 01:38 - Dhaani: Chest pain at one point for a couple days, about 2 weeks ago.
25/12/2018, 01:38 - Dhaani: And the shaking, shortness of breath and face twitching was on Friday.
25/12/2018, 01:38 - Munjaal: did you see a cardiologist for the above ?
25/12/2018, 01:40 - Dhaani: No. Not yet
25/12/2018, 01:40 - Munjaal: okay
25/12/2018, 01:41 - Munjaal: I've relayed the info to Riddhi, she's reconfirming with her friends
25/12/2018, 01:41 - Munjaal: *friend
25/12/2018, 01:41 - Munjaal: *doctor friend
25/12/2018, 01:41 - Dhaani: Fair enough
25/12/2018, 01:41 - Dhaani: 🙈
25/12/2018, 01:42 - Munjaal: It logically can't be a stroke at this age , very rare
25/12/2018, 01:43 - Dhaani: Alright
25/12/2018, 01:53 - Munjaal: okay
25/12/2018, 01:54 - Munjaal: so you need to meet an MD Med
25/12/2018, 01:54 - Munjaal: appointment
25/12/2018, 01:54 - Munjaal: if he tells you to go to a neurologist then do si
25/12/2018, 01:54 - Dhaani: What does your friend think?
25/12/2018, 01:55 - Munjaal: b.t.w was there slurring of speech
25/12/2018, 01:55 - Munjaal: she on call asking
25/12/2018, 01:58 - Dhaani: I don't know.
25/12/2018, 01:58 - Munjaal: hmm
25/12/2018, 01:58 - Dhaani: Was struggling to talk. Too short of breath
25/12/2018, 02:01 - Munjaal: okay
25/12/2018, 02:01 - Munjaal: slurring is a symptom of stroke
25/12/2018, 02:02 - Dhaani: I know but I honestly don't know if I was slurring
25/12/2018, 02:02 - Munjaal: that's okay
25/12/2018, 02:02 - Munjaal: in any case you need to go to an MD
25/12/2018, 02:04 - Dhaani: What does Riddhi suspect?
25/12/2018, 02:04 - Munjaal: it's a little harder to corner without tests
25/12/2018, 02:15 - Dhaani: I get that
25/12/2018, 02:17 - Munjaal: she says it sounds like a stroke but you're too young
25/12/2018, 02:17 - Munjaal: other than that could be a nerve issue
25/12/2018, 09:56 - Dhaani: 😕
25/12/2018, 21:28 - Munjaal: Did you go to a doctor or take an appointment ?
27/12/2018, 16:56 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
27/12/2018, 16:57 - Munjaal: P.S: I hope you've at lease taken an appointment
27/12/2018, 17:19 - Dhaani: 🙈
27/12/2018, 17:19 - Dhaani: Waiting for reference to a good reliable doctor
27/12/2018, 17:30 - Munjaal: Hmmm
27/12/2018, 17:30 - Munjaal: Health been okay or went bad again
27/12/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: It's been kind of ok.
27/12/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: Bp is still high
27/12/2018, 17:32 - Dhaani: And energy levels are really low. Like really really low
27/12/2018, 18:22 - Munjaal: 😕

22/05/2019, 12:09 - Dhaani: I do. Which is why I worry
22/05/2019, 12:10 - Munjaal: 😅
22/05/2019, 12:11 - Munjaal: Just a little confused about what to do
22/05/2019, 12:11 - Munjaal: Job/Internship/Research papers or something
22/05/2019, 12:29 - Dhaani: Ohkay
22/05/2019, 12:30 - Dhaani: Narrowed down your options?
22/05/2019, 12:32 - Munjaal: Played games on an average of 185 hours in two weeks
22/05/2019, 12:32 - Dhaani: You realize that's absolutely ridiculous
22/05/2019, 12:36 - Munjaal: 🤤
22/05/2019, 12:39 - Munjaal: Cause this
22/05/2019, 12:54 - Dhaani: 😒

24/05/2019, 15:28 - Dhaani: Ask
24/05/2019, 15:29 - Munjaal: Is there a way to not get weird dreams
24/05/2019, 15:29 - Dhaani: I haven't no idea.
24/05/2019, 15:29 - Dhaani: I have needed such a way too in phases.
24/05/2019, 15:29 - Dhaani: What's going on?
24/05/2019, 15:30 - Munjaal: nvm ... Just a tiring repetition that I'd like to avoid having to go through every sleep
24/05/2019, 15:30 - Dhaani: Tell me?
24/05/2019, 15:30 - Dhaani: What's the weird dream about?
24/05/2019, 15:32 - Munjaal: To keep it to a few words, the kind that reminds you of the real you despite your efforts to build up a fake one
24/05/2019, 15:33 - Munjaal: The "in yo face bitch" is kinda annoying
24/05/2019, 15:33 - Dhaani: I'll give you a call today after work, ok?
24/05/2019, 15:33 - Dhaani: And the real you is whoever you have chosen to be.
24/05/2019, 15:33 - Munjaal: Umm ... okay
24/05/2019, 15:33 - Dhaani: And you're wonderful.
24/05/2019, 15:34 - Munjaal: Don't worry I'm fine, just a weird temporal phase or something
24/05/2019, 15:34 - Munjaal: Probably delayed withdrawal
24/05/2019, 15:36 - Dhaani: 😕
24/05/2019, 15:36 - Dhaani: How have you been though? Overall?
24/05/2019, 15:37 - Munjaal: Besides having nothing to do.. Quite fine I guess
24/05/2019, 15:37 - Munjaal: I'll disturb you later, post your work

15/06/2020, 17:32 - Dhaani: Along with other gift, I want to get him a Naruto related thing. And I figured a keychain is something he can always keep on him.
15/06/2020, 17:32 - Dhaani: Are any of these decent?
15/06/2020, 17:32 - Munjaal: Any of the one with non moving parts should last
15/06/2020, 17:33 - Dhaani: And relevance wise?
15/06/2020, 17:33 - Munjaal: The leaf village one would appeal to the largest common denominator
15/06/2020, 17:33 - Munjaal: If you know anything about his favourite character , it'd help a lot
15/06/2020, 17:34 - Dhaani: I don't and no way of asking since he knows I haven't watched it.
15/06/2020, 17:36 - Munjaal: I see
15/06/2020, 17:38 - Munjaal: wait lemme find a few more
15/06/2020, 17:39 - Dhaani: I did like the leaf village one. It's quite sober looking, won't draw too much attention.
15/06/2020, 17:39 - Munjaal: Yep
15/06/2020, 17:39 - Munjaal: I'm seeing a few rings too, would that be over the top ?
15/06/2020, 17:40 - Dhaani: Rings?
15/06/2020, 17:40 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
15/06/2020, 17:40 - Dhaani: He definitely won't wear

16/07/2020, 08:10 - Dhaani: Not exactly. Tell me
16/07/2020, 08:11 - Munjaal: Have an interview today evening :/ , could I ask for some quick tips ?
16/07/2020, 08:11 - Dhaani: Sure.
16/07/2020, 08:11 - Munjaal: b.t.w beard okay or not okay ?

P.S: I'm gonna be wearing a coat and tie
16/07/2020, 08:12 - Munjaal: Tis trimmed a bit though
16/07/2020, 08:13 - Munjaal: Actually, I'll just send you a pic later, sometime before the interview, if it's okay with you. Lemme know if look acceptable then ?
16/07/2020, 08:16 - Dhaani: If you keep the beard, it has to be very properly trimmed and combed.
16/07/2020, 08:16 - Dhaani: Yup
16/07/2020, 08:16 - Dhaani: Interview with? What's the role?
16/07/2020, 08:21 - Munjaal: Research assistant
16/07/2020, 08:23 - Munjaal: It is an innovation ventures company in the US focusing on designing governance policies with respect to the upcoming technologies (Fourth Industrial Revolution)
16/07/2020, 08:23 - Dhaani: Sounds really interesting
16/07/2020, 08:24 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 08:26 - Dhaani: That looks crazy
16/07/2020, 08:26 - Dhaani: Baba, I'd been meaning to ask you something else?
16/07/2020, 08:28 - Munjaal: Oh ..okayy
16/07/2020, 08:30 - Dhaani: Do you remember the laser project I worked on years ago?
16/07/2020, 08:30 - Dhaani: The one you recommended using a motor for to bring down cost?
16/07/2020, 08:30 - Munjaal: Yeah
16/07/2020, 08:31 - Dhaani: What would you think about building a prototype and filing for a patent together?
16/07/2020, 08:31 - Dhaani: Like I know it's not a great project but having a patent would be nice.
16/07/2020, 08:32 - Munjaal: That'd be really fun. There's a major drawback in lack of resources though.
16/07/2020, 08:32 - Munjaal: All were from China
16/07/2020, 08:32 - Dhaani: True. But we'll figure that out.
16/07/2020, 08:33 - Dhaani: It's just, I quite regret not going through with the patent process. Would have helped me a lot
16/07/2020, 08:33 - Dhaani: And I figured, considering the roles you're aiming for, it would probably help you too
16/07/2020, 08:33 - Munjaal: Yup
16/07/2020, 08:35 - Dhaani: The only problem will be time. 🙈
16/07/2020, 08:36 - Munjaal: And workplace
16/07/2020, 08:36 - Dhaani: And locating my old notes. 🙈🙈
16/07/2020, 08:50 - Munjaal: could do a part practical part theoretical research about the laser spot energy required to burn through an insect
16/07/2020, 08:50 - Munjaal: unless you've already done that and it was in your notes
16/07/2020, 08:55 - Dhaani: Not in an organised manner, no.

18/08/2020, 15:21 - Dhaani: Thank you!
18/08/2020, 15:22 - Munjaal: Just spoke with Kashyap sir, he said that the exam dept doesn't often come to the college physically so he cannot ask, instead he suggested mailing them directly
18/08/2020, 15:23 - Dhaani: Alright
20/08/2020, 15:04 - Dhaani: Hey
20/08/2020, 15:05 - Dhaani: Any idea what email id do we send that mail to?

20/08/2020, 15:06 - Dhaani: 😒
20/08/2020, 15:07 - Munjaal: Dunno about this, I'll message Kashyap sir
20/08/2020, 15:07 - Munjaal: back issue is back in full force, cant walk or turn, have an antalgic lean. 🤷🏻‍♂️
20/08/2020, 15:08 - Munjaal: correction:- can walk but slower than a granny with arthritis
20/08/2020, 15:09 - Dhaani: Ok. Got in touch with your doctor?
20/08/2020, 15:09 - Munjaal: Asked riddhi about what to do, she said rest and take anti inflammatory meds. That's about all i can do for now
20/08/2020, 15:09 - Munjaal: it should subside fully in about 5 to 6 weeks
20/08/2020, 15:30 - Dhaani: Baba, please take care
20/08/2020, 15:31 - Munjaal: aye aye, this one ain't serious at all, just painful :P

21/08/2020, 12:33 - Dhaani: I had a look at the e-transcript. That mentions the medium of instruction as English.

21/08/2020, 15:52 - Munjaal: I didn't notice 😅
21/08/2020, 15:52 - Dhaani: Haan. First page. There they've mentioned joining year and duration and everything.

30/10/2020, 01:00 - Munjaal: In the house yeah...if that counts
30/10/2020, 01:00 - Dhaani: When are you giving GRE?
30/10/2020, 01:00 - Dhaani: 🙈
I meant outside
30/10/2020, 01:00 - Munjaal: Probably 2 weeks from now
30/10/2020, 01:01 - Dhaani: Oh!
30/10/2020, 01:01 - Munjaal: I'll finalize the date wrt to the deadline of universities
30/10/2020, 01:01 - Dhaani: Makes sense
30/10/2020, 01:01 - Munjaal: Heh , nope. That's suicide for me
30/10/2020, 01:01 - Dhaani: Why so?
30/10/2020, 01:02 - Munjaal: Given my lungs couldn't handle the most banal of bacterium, COVID is most probably lethal
30/10/2020, 01:02 - Dhaani: Fair
30/10/2020, 01:02 - Munjaal: If not lethal, I'd definitely suffer permanent lung scarring
30/10/2020, 01:03 - Dhaani: I was asking because I've been in town since last week. Staying with mum. She and I got tested today and we're both negative.
30/10/2020, 01:03 - Dhaani: Which means I can meet people without worrying about being an asymptomatic carrier, I guess
30/10/2020, 01:03 - Munjaal: 😃
30/10/2020, 01:03 - Dhaani: I just have to be very selective of who I meet.
30/10/2020, 01:04 - Munjaal: When where how .....
30/10/2020, 01:04 - Dhaani: Not sure about when. Woh thoda dekhna padega
30/10/2020, 01:05 - Dhaani: Can you commute at all?
30/10/2020, 03:12 - Munjaal: Sorry for the delay, got caught up in work
30/10/2020, 03:12 - Munjaal: Out of the blue
30/10/2020, 03:12 - Munjaal: I can, I just avoid it
30/10/2020, 03:12 - Munjaal: But I'll come to meet you 😑
30/10/2020, 19:14 - Munjaal: hello
30/10/2020, 19:24 - Dhaani: Hello

30/10/2020, 19:27 - Munjaal: Okey
30/10/2020, 19:27 - Dhaani: Chalega na?
30/10/2020, 19:27 - Munjaal: Yup
30/10/2020, 19:27 - Dhaani: Also, how will you commute if you come?
30/10/2020, 19:27 - Munjaal: Uber or something
30/10/2020, 19:27 - Dhaani: 😕
30/10/2020, 19:28 - Dhaani: I'll see if I can borrow mum's car and pick you up.
30/10/2020, 19:28 - Munjaal: You sure ? It'll be a pain to drive that long
30/10/2020, 19:28 - Dhaani: Is ok. I would rather you avoid cabs.
30/10/2020, 19:29 - Munjaal: Okey 😅
01/11/2020, 14:37 - Dhaani: Oi

12/11/2020, 21:20 - Dhaani: Munjaal, what's going on
12/11/2020, 21:21 - Munjaal: Honestly no idea. Haven't even had any coffee
12/11/2020, 21:23 - Munjaal: It's down to 92 now. Must be something random
12/11/2020, 22:52 - Dhaani: Ohkay
12/11/2020, 22:53 - Dhaani: Munjaal, I am flying back to Mumbai tomorrow.

14/11/2020, 09:17 - Dhaani: Thank you 😊😊
23/11/2020, 14:39 - Munjaal: Random question: would vanilla essence taste good in black coffee without sugar ? Or would it need sugar for the taste ?
23/11/2020, 14:40 - Dhaani: I actually don't know.
23/11/2020, 14:40 - Dhaani: But if there is no sugar, maybe stick to just a drop or two.
23/11/2020, 14:40 - Munjaal: Ok
23/11/2020, 14:41 - Munjaal: Thanks 😛
23/11/2020, 15:27 - Dhaani: Let me know how it turns out

27/11/2020, 10:43 - Munjaal: I'm too confused to decide tbh
27/11/2020, 10:49 - Dhaani: 😕
27/11/2020, 10:49 - Dhaani: How is prep?

27/11/2020, 10:59 - Munjaal: If I get a satisfactory result I'll apply for the test
27/11/2020, 10:59 - Munjaal: Otherwise I'll just give TOEFL for now
27/11/2020, 10:59 - Dhaani: Theek hai

13/01/2021, 19:04 - Dhaani: Do you have an opinion?
13/01/2021, 19:04 - Dhaani: My nephew is about to buy a new laptop 🙈
15/01/2021, 14:45 - Munjaal: What price range?
15/01/2021, 14:48 - Dhaani: I am not sure.
15/01/2021, 14:49 - Dhaani: Ek second, I am asking him about what he needs it for.
15/01/2021, 14:51 - Munjaal: In any case I'd prefer a Ryzen CPU over Intel these days
15/01/2021, 14:53 - Dhaani: Right.
15/01/2021, 14:54 - Dhaani: So he is 13. Has gotten into programming and also learning the basics of machine learning, I think.
15/01/2021, 14:54 - Munjaal: 13 ?
15/01/2021, 14:54 - Dhaani: 13 years old.
15/01/2021, 14:54 - Munjaal: I know that
15/01/2021, 14:55 - Munjaal: He really shouldn't be looking into any high performance laptops if he's 13
15/01/2021, 14:55 - Munjaal: Desktops will serve him much much better
15/01/2021, 14:56 - Dhaani: True
15/01/2021, 14:56 - Dhaani: That's difficult. He switches between his parent's homes.
15/01/2021, 14:56 - Munjaal: Ah okay. I see
15/01/2021, 14:57 - Dhaani: So his current laptop is giving him trouble but I don't think he has any idea about what's the basic he needs to be able to explore his interests.
15/01/2021, 14:58 - Munjaal: Has he got any interest in gaming ?
15/01/2021, 14:58 - Munjaal: Or is he gonna play any games on the laptop ?
15/01/2021, 15:02 - Dhaani: Just minecraft
15/01/2021, 15:05 - Dhaani: So he is now thinking of just upgrading his current laptop.
15/01/2021, 20:06 - Munjaal: Hmm
15/01/2021, 20:06 - Munjaal: Other than ram and storage there isn't much you need upgrade in a laptop

08/05/2021, 01:40 - Dhaani: Oi
08/05/2021, 01:40 - Munjaal: Hello
08/05/2021, 01:40 - Dhaani: Busy?
08/05/2021, 01:40 - Munjaal: Nope
08/05/2021, 01:41 - Munjaal: Sup
08/05/2021, 01:41 - Munjaal: I'll call you right back.
08/05/2021, 01:41 - Munjaal: Gimme 2 mins
08/05/2021, 01:41 - Dhaani: Sure
08/05/2021, 02:28 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
08/05/2021, 02:49 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
24/05/2021, 01:14 - Munjaal: Hello, sorry was caught up in a very heated game
24/05/2021, 01:14 - Munjaal: And then I forgot to call later
31/05/2021, 17:45 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
31/05/2021, 17:49 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
03/06/2021, 19:34 - Munjaal: How or where does one even start something like this :/ ?
03/06/2021, 19:35 - Dhaani: What?
03/06/2021, 19:36 - Dhaani: Something like what?
03/06/2021, 19:36 - Munjaal: Letter
03/06/2021, 19:37 - Dhaani: I'd record a voice note of what I want to say. Then transcribe it and start editing
03/06/2021, 19:38 - Munjaal: I see. That might help. Arigatou
03/06/2021, 19:43 - Dhaani: Ty it. Otherwise we'll figure something else
23/06/2021, 19:28 - Dhaani: Hey, listen
23/06/2021, 19:28 - Munjaal: Sup
23/06/2021, 19:28 - Dhaani: Do you know any places to get laser engraving done these days?
23/06/2021, 19:28 - Munjaal: Plenty of shops in jogeshwari
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Dhaani: Any in particular that you recommend?
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Munjaal: What kind of engraving is it ?
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Dhaani: To get something laser engraved in a watch
23/06/2021, 20:30 - Munjaal: Hey sorry, was away
23/06/2021, 20:30 - Munjaal: What base material, metal or leather
23/06/2021, 20:30 - Munjaal: Or silicone
23/06/2021, 20:31 - Dhaani: Metal, I think
23/06/2021, 20:31 - Munjaal: Oh
23/06/2021, 20:31 - Munjaal: That would be difficult and expensive
23/06/2021, 20:32 - Munjaal: Usually etching on metal is done using a chemical along with the laser
23/06/2021, 20:32 - Munjaal: That isn't available in jogeshwari
23/06/2021, 20:51 - Dhaani: Oh ok
23/06/2021, 20:51 - Dhaani: Where can that be done
23/06/2021, 21:06 - Munjaal: I haven't been able to find it either
23/06/2021, 21:11 - Dhaani: Oh ok
26/06/2021, 22:39 - Dhaani: Hey
26/06/2021, 22:48 - Munjaal: sup
26/06/2021, 22:59 - Dhaani: Busy?
26/06/2021, 23:33 - Munjaal: ingame atm
26/06/2021, 23:33 - Munjaal: and don't have my phone anymore for a few days :p
26/06/2021, 23:48 - Dhaani: Oh ok
26/06/2021, 23:48 - Dhaani: I actually needed some help
26/06/2021, 23:48 - Dhaani: Can we speak later tonight?
26/06/2021, 23:49 - Munjaal: sure, do you have any sort of voip app ?
26/06/2021, 23:49 - Munjaal: skype/discord or anything of the sort
26/06/2021, 23:50 - Dhaani: Skype?
26/06/2021, 23:50 - Munjaal: yeah that'll doo
26/06/2021, 23:53 - Munjaal: I'm done with my match, lemme know when you wanna talk
26/06/2021, 23:54 - Munjaal: if there's time I'll play another one
27/06/2021, 14:42 - Dhaani: Tariq Mobin Shaikh ISB Hyd.vcf (file attached)
27/06/2021, 14:59 - Munjaal: thanks :)
27/06/2021, 16:09 - Dhaani: You haven't reached out to him?
27/06/2021, 16:32 - Munjaal: hey, was going to
27/06/2021, 16:32 - Munjaal: stuck in something
27/06/2021, 16:33 - Munjaal: is it too late
27/06/2021, 17:09 - Dhaani: Nahi. Reach out and figure out a time to connect
28/06/2021, 13:14 - Dhaani: Was he able to help?
29/06/2021, 17:01 - Dhaani: Oi.
30/06/2021, 10:55 - Dhaani: Hey, is everything ok?
30/06/2021, 14:49 - Munjaal: Hello
30/06/2021, 14:50 - Munjaal: Mostly yeah, I guess
30/06/2021, 14:50 - Dhaani: Kya hua?
30/06/2021, 14:50 - Dhaani: And how did the Monday meeting go?
30/06/2021, 14:50 - Munjaal: He is probably still stuck in Ranchi
30/06/2021, 14:51 - Dhaani: Ohkay?
30/06/2021, 14:51 - Dhaani: Probably? You don't know for certain?
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Munjaal: Will let is know then he's back, till then we were asked to cooperate with his networking/programming head
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Dhaani: Ohkay
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Munjaal: He said he's stuck last time and that he might be back on monday
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Dhaani: You didn't end up reaching out to Tariq na?
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Munjaal: You at home atm ?
30/06/2021, 14:52 - Dhaani: Actually, more importantly, why mostly?
30/06/2021, 14:53 - Dhaani: Nahi. Panvel.
30/06/2021, 14:53 - Munjaal: Oh
30/06/2021, 14:53 - Dhaani: Need to first get the door opened and actually see what the inside is arranged like now before we can figure out the camera situation na
30/06/2021, 14:53 - Munjaal: Yup
30/06/2021, 14:54 - Dhaani: Listen, any idea what's the minimum time it would take to arrange for the cameras?
30/06/2021, 14:54 - Munjaal: Depends on which one you'd select
30/06/2021, 14:54 - Munjaal: The ones on Amazon would arrive in about a week or less
30/06/2021, 14:55 - Munjaal: Anything from China would take anywhere from 15 to 90 days
30/06/2021, 14:55 - Dhaani: Oh ok
30/06/2021, 14:55 - Munjaal: There's a few analog cameras available at robu
30/06/2021, 14:55 - Munjaal: They'll arrive in 2 days
30/06/2021, 14:55 - Dhaani: Ohkay
30/06/2021, 14:56 - Munjaal: What did your mom say about the charger ?
30/06/2021, 14:56 - Dhaani: I don't think waiting for over a week would be a good idea.
30/06/2021, 14:56 - Dhaani: We'll have to see how much clutter is there to be able to tell if it would look out of place na
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Dhaani: I'll show you once we're inside and then we can figure this out?
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Munjaal: Yup yup
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Munjaal: Makes sense
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Dhaani: But more importantly, why mostly!
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Dhaani: *?
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Munjaal: Later later
30/06/2021, 14:57 - Munjaal: Nothing serious don't worry 😛
30/06/2021, 15:50 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
30/06/2021, 15:50 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
30/06/2021, 15:50 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>

30/06/2021, 15:50 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
30/06/2021, 15:52 - Dhaani: Can we find a camera for the unused light fitting spaces? We could short the switch for those ones so power won't be a constraint and the switch won't look like it's on.
30/06/2021, 15:57 - Dhaani: Also, this room is adjacent to the neighbour's and they've agreed to us using their wifi
30/06/2021, 15:58 - Munjaal: Hmm
30/06/2021, 15:58 - Dhaani: Difficult?
30/06/2021, 15:58 - Munjaal: I'll check for the cams
30/06/2021, 15:59 - Munjaal: You'll get a lot of analog cams, the problem would be figuring out how to transmit/store
30/06/2021, 15:59 - Munjaal: Let me look into those
30/06/2021, 16:00 - Dhaani: Ohkay.
30/06/2021, 16:02 - Dhaani: I'll call you up once I get home?
30/06/2021, 16:10 - Munjaal: Okay
01/07/2021, 22:51 - Dhaani: Missed voice call
02/07/2021, 00:11 - Munjaal: Hello

02/07/2021, 00:56 - Munjaal: Yeah just didn't have my phone with me + caffeine burnout
02/07/2021, 01:00 - Dhaani: Oh ok

02/07/2021, 01:16 - Munjaal: Okay

04/07/2021, 00:09 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
04/07/2021, 00:33 - Dhaani: Did you also order a wifi booster thing?
04/07/2021, 03:31 - Munjaal: nah, kinda forgot about that one
04/07/2021, 03:40 - Dhaani: Oh ok
04/07/2021, 03:41 - Dhaani: You use this number only na, as your Google pay number?
04/07/2021, 03:41 - Munjaal: Aye
04/07/2021, 03:43 - Dhaani: Google pay is telling me to try later 😕

13/07/2021, 17:40 - Dhaani: Listen, can we do Panvel tomorrow morning?
13/07/2021, 18:30 - Munjaal: Tomorrow would be difficult
13/07/2021, 18:30 - Munjaal: Haven't been able to complete the entire setup yet, got caught up in the meeting
13/07/2021, 18:57 - Dhaani: Theek hai
13/07/2021, 18:57 - Dhaani: Any chance we can do day after then? 🙈
13/07/2021, 18:58 - Dhaani: Because we can't do Fridays Saturdays and Sundays and I was really hoping we could do this before this weekend.
13/07/2021, 21:19 - Dhaani: Also how was the meeting!
13/07/2021, 21:19 - Dhaani: *?
14/07/2021, 01:01 - Munjaal: It was good, but a lot of sudden work was dumped on us as a result
14/07/2021, 01:02 - Munjaal: Mostly but I can't confirm yet, they've lined up another meeting and submissions
14/07/2021, 02:51 - Dhaani: Theek hai. Let me know
14/07/2021, 02:51 - Dhaani: What's up?
14/07/2021, 06:20 - Munjaal: The grand scheme was revealed to us. Setting up multiple smart clinics at the village level. We need to design the clinic, decide the equipment and come up with a road plan in collaboration with doctors and present it to them.
14/07/2021, 13:47 - Dhaani: Oh wow
14/07/2021, 13:47 - Dhaani: By when?
14/07/2021, 15:09 - Munjaal: In 3 days or so

17/07/2021, 18:38 - Dhaani: How did the meeting go?
17/07/2021, 19:18 - Munjaal: Umm
17/07/2021, 19:18 - Munjaal: There's a major SOS
17/07/2021, 19:19 - Munjaal: Not just with work but family stuff
17/07/2021, 19:19 - Munjaal: I don't think I can talk about it but I might end up disappearing for a while
17/07/2021, 19:23 - Dhaani: Oh

17/07/2021, 19:24 - Munjaal: Nope, can't
17/07/2021, 19:24 - Dhaani: Alright
17/07/2021, 19:24 - Dhaani: How soon are you disappearing?
17/07/2021, 19:25 - Munjaal: I dunno
17/07/2021, 19:25 - Munjaal: w.r.t the cameras I can pre set them up and ship them to you
17/07/2021, 19:25 - Munjaal: I'm afraid I'm locked in here till this resolves though
17/07/2021, 19:26 - Munjaal: It'll be plug and play
17/07/2021, 19:26 - Munjaal: Or I can pay you back the sum
17/07/2021, 19:26 - Dhaani: Alright. But will be connected with the lighting wala wires na, not actual plug?
17/07/2021, 19:27 - Dhaani: That would be great
17/07/2021, 19:27 - Munjaal: Two wires, live neutral
17/07/2021, 19:27 - Dhaani: Alright
17/07/2021, 19:27 - Munjaal: Twist them with the connection cables, add tape, done

17/07/2021, 19:28 - Munjaal: But don't think about it too much please.
17/07/2021, 19:28 - Munjaal: Something only I can fix
17/07/2021, 19:29 - Dhaani: You know that's not possible
17/07/2021, 19:29 - Dhaani: You know I am always here, right?
17/07/2021, 19:30 - Munjaal: Thanks 😅
18/07/2021, 17:29 - Munjaal: She's a therapist right ?, Would you happen to have any contact for a psychiatrist ?
18/07/2021, 17:35 - Dhaani: Haan, therapist
18/07/2021, 17:36 - Dhaani: I will have to ask around for psychiatrist or you can ask her. 😕
18/07/2021, 17:36 - Munjaal: Oh okay
18/07/2021, 17:37 - Munjaal: No no I have a few contacts who probably know, lemme ask around
18/07/2021, 17:37 - Dhaani: All the psychiatrists I know of are really bad. 🙈
18/07/2021, 17:37 - Munjaal: That's what I'm worried about too
18/07/2021, 18:06 - Dhaani: I trust Shweta's recommendations
18/07/2021, 18:07 - Dhaani: Anjali Chhabria is an absolute no no though.
20/07/2021, 10:54 - Dhaani: Hey
20/07/2021, 10:54 - Dhaani: Will you be able to send the cameras today?
20/07/2021, 17:42 - Dhaani: Hey

21/07/2021, 03:32 - Dhaani: Munjaal?
22/07/2021, 16:31 - Dhaani: Munjaal, I am getting worried
22/07/2021, 16:31 - Dhaani: Are you ok?
23/07/2021, 06:30 - Munjaal: Hey, sorry for the delay
23/07/2021, 06:31 - Munjaal: Just a sudden overload, nothing major
23/07/2021, 06:31 - Munjaal: Type out your address and gimme a timeslot I'll wefast em accordingly
23/07/2021, 06:33 - Munjaal: Also, DO NOT PLUG EM IN before letting me know. There's a few things you need to do unless you want electrocution at best and unforseen family barbeque at worst.
23/07/2021, 10:45 - Dhaani: Ohkay
23/07/2021, 10:46 - Dhaani: You're fine?
23/07/2021, 10:46 - Dhaani: Is there anything I can do?

23/07/2021, 10:47 - Dhaani: Give Mumma's number. 9821141190
23/07/2021, 10:48 - Dhaani: What all do I need to carry, other than electric tape and the wire stripper/cutter.
23/07/2021, 11:06 - Munjaal: That should be all
23/07/2021, 11:26 - Dhaani: Alright
23/07/2021, 11:27 - Dhaani: Munjaal, you're taking care of yourself?
23/07/2021, 11:27 - Munjaal: Aye aye
23/07/2021, 11:27 - Dhaani: Pakka?
23/07/2021, 11:27 - Munjaal: Yup

23/07/2021, 18:05 - Munjaal: Call me once you're free and have access to the package
23/07/2021, 19:10 - Dhaani: Will do. In a little time? At the dentist's
23/07/2021, 19:10 - Munjaal: okay
23/07/2021, 23:41 - Munjaal: Call not connecting
27/07/2021, 18:09 - Dhaani: Hey
27/07/2021, 18:09 - Dhaani: The camera didn't fit.
28/07/2021, 03:28 - Munjaal: Oh
28/07/2021, 03:28 - Munjaal: Smaller than that form factor is really tough to get
28/07/2021, 09:54 - Dhaani: 😕
28/07/2021, 09:54 - Dhaani: What to do?
28/07/2021, 13:41 - Munjaal: How much space was there ?
28/07/2021, 13:42 - Munjaal: Did you take a pic of the space ?

27/08/2022, 15:03 - Dhaani: ?

27/08/2022, 15:04 - Munjaal: All good here so don't worry
28/08/2022, 21:00 - Munjaal: Random advice required: I've got a full beard, should I ditch it ?
28/08/2022, 21:00 - Munjaal: Objective answer needed
28/08/2022, 21:01 - Dhaani: I think a well trimmed short beard is a good bet. If you can't be consistent with maintaining that, then ditch it.
28/08/2022, 21:02 - Munjaal: Hmmm ok
28/08/2022, 21:02 - Munjaal: Would a reference picture help ?
28/08/2022, 21:11 - Dhaani: Yes
28/08/2022, 21:21 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
28/08/2022, 21:21 - Dhaani: Too long. Maximum a beard half this length
28/08/2022, 21:23 - Munjaal: Hmm.. Okay
03/09/2022, 02:24 - Munjaal: Sensei, I shall need thy guidance soon. But I wish not to trouble thee too much. Let me know when free ? 😛
03/09/2022, 16:54 - Munjaal: https://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Someone-to-Love-Themselves?amp=1

04/09/2022, 01:24 - Munjaal: I owe you a dinner at the very least or anything you ask for. Thank you :')

07/09/2022, 18:40 - Dhaani: What's up? What about you?
07/09/2022, 18:40 - Munjaal: Took today off, was a little exhausted
07/09/2022, 18:40 - Munjaal: You're working after hours ? 😕
07/09/2022, 18:41 - Dhaani: After hours?
07/09/2022, 18:41 - Dhaani: There is no after hours
07/09/2022, 18:41 - Dhaani: My last scheduled meeting for today is at 10.
07/09/2022, 18:41 - Munjaal: Wow

13/09/2022, 23:32 - Dhaani: Come!!!!
13/09/2022, 23:33 - Dhaani: I miss you!

13/09/2022, 23:34 - Munjaal: Hahaha, okay
13/09/2022, 23:44 - Dhaani: You made my week
13/09/2022, 23:44 - Dhaani: By telling me you're coming
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Munjaal: I was thinking of showing up and surprising you instead
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Dhaani: Arre no
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Munjaal: But was worried you might reallocate time
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Dhaani: Then there are high chances you won't find me home
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Dhaani: This is better
13/09/2022, 23:45 - Dhaani: That way I'll keep the weekend clear

18/09/2022, 10:44 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
18/09/2022, 10:45 - Munjaal: This entire image was made by an AI
18/09/2022, 20:01 - Munjaal: Boarded
19/09/2022, 10:42 - Dhaani: Oi.
19/09/2022, 10:42 - Dhaani: Reached na?
19/09/2022, 10:56 - Munjaal: Yupp
19/09/2022, 10:56 - Munjaal: Safely
19/09/2022, 10:59 - Dhaani: Good
19/09/2022, 10:59 - Dhaani: Yaar, I am thoda worried about one thing.
19/09/2022, 11:00 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
19/09/2022, 11:37 - Munjaal: 😕
19/09/2022, 11:37 - Munjaal: Did you finalize on the appointment ?
19/09/2022, 11:51 - Dhaani: Not yet.
19/09/2022, 12:18 - Munjaal: Get one online at least, if you don't wanna visit physically try
19/09/2022, 12:18 - Munjaal: *physically yet
19/09/2022, 13:04 - Dhaani: Nahi, I'll mostly go on Wednesday or Thursday
19/09/2022, 13:05 - Dhaani: Haven't booked yet because I might have to go to office on one of those two days and I don't know which one
19/09/2022, 13:08 - Munjaal: I see
19/09/2022, 20:35 - Munjaal: https://m.fnp.com/gift/mesmerising-orchids-bouquet?pos=10#/product-page
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Dhaani: Blue orchids or normal orchids? What's her preference?
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Munjaal: I have no clue
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Dhaani: Because blue orchids aren't natural either. They're made that way with ink, if I am not mistaken.
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Munjaal: Forget that
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Dhaani: ?
20/09/2022, 20:59 - Munjaal: Any clarity on this ?
20/09/2022, 21:00 - Dhaani: Nahi.
20/09/2022, 21:00 - Dhaani: Turns out, Mithun's friend got covid. Mithun was exposed and is showing mild symptoms now. And I stayed over with him after dropping you on Sunday.
20/09/2022, 21:00 - Dhaani: So currently isolating.
20/09/2022, 21:00 - Munjaal: Oopsies
20/09/2022, 21:00 - Dhaani: Only once I am sure I am in the clear will I book an appointment.
20/09/2022, 21:01 - Munjaal: Rapid Antigen ?
20/09/2022, 21:03 - Dhaani: Meanwhile, right now, I have the design review I was stressing about in half an hour. Had such a long day, I am already exhausted and just want to curl up and sleep.
20/09/2022, 21:04 - Munjaal: Ah well, push through it if you can.
20/09/2022, 21:05 - Munjaal: Sec
20/09/2022, 21:54 - Dhaani: Still on the first review 😂
20/09/2022, 21:54 - Dhaani: I called it
20/09/2022, 22:00 - Dhaani: And we're still on the first review.
20/09/2022, 22:01 - Munjaal: XD
20/09/2022, 22:02 - Dhaani: 😂😂
20/09/2022, 22:03 - Dhaani: Let's hope there isn't as much back and forth and interrogation on mine
20/09/2022, 22:03 - Dhaani: Because my engineering lead hasn't joined the call, my designer is on leave and the design intern is quite clueless and new.
20/09/2022, 22:07 - Dhaani: And we're still on the first one.
20/09/2022, 22:10 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
20/09/2022, 22:11 - Munjaal: Oops
20/09/2022, 22:14 - Dhaani: Did you just give me a notes group?
20/09/2022, 22:17 - Munjaal: yup
20/09/2022, 22:36 - Munjaal: Gimme 5 mins
20/09/2022, 23:33 - Dhaani: Do you know the level of bodyache where your individual teeth sockets start to hurt?
20/09/2022, 23:34 - Munjaal: Nope, haven't felt any pain that specific
20/09/2022, 23:34 - Dhaani: Like very very very mildly but it is weird.
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Munjaal: I've had jaw muscles hurt in viral fever
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Munjaal: Not teeth though
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Dhaani: It's not teeth themselves. Teeth sockets, like essentially the entire length of the jaw.
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Dhaani: And my facial twitching has started.
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Munjaal: Oh, yeah that has happened
20/09/2022, 23:35 - Dhaani: And I've got a splitting headache
20/09/2022, 23:36 - Munjaal: Uh oh
20/09/2022, 23:36 - Munjaal: Is that sos scenario ?
20/09/2022, 23:36 - Dhaani: No.
20/09/2022, 23:37 - Munjaal: You've got any meds for that ?
20/09/2022, 23:40 - Dhaani: Sleep
21/09/2022, 11:53 - Munjaal: How're you feeling today ?
21/09/2022, 13:21 - Dhaani: Much better today
21/09/2022, 13:21 - Dhaani: Maybe I just needed the rest
21/09/2022, 13:21 - Dhaani: Even bp and heart rate are normal now
21/09/2022, 13:21 - Munjaal: Nice
21/09/2022, 22:47 - Munjaal: All still good na ?
22/09/2022, 00:00 - Dhaani: Haan, ok only
22/09/2022, 00:00 - Munjaal: 😁
22/09/2022, 22:48 - Munjaal: Hello
22/09/2022, 22:48 - Dhaani: Hello
22/09/2022, 22:49 - Dhaani: I just got done with work for the day
22/09/2022, 22:51 - Munjaal: How was it ?
23/09/2022, 00:05 - Dhaani: <Media omitted>
23/09/2022, 13:30 - Dhaani: What?
23/09/2022, 13:30 - Munjaal: I'm hungry, looking at that makes me hungrier
23/09/2022, 13:31 - Munjaal: 🥲
23/09/2022, 19:07 - Munjaal: How's your health ?
24/09/2022, 19:01 - Dhaani: Both Mithun and I tested negative
24/09/2022, 19:05 - Munjaal: Nicee
25/09/2022, 22:09 - Dhaani: Oi. I won't be available via calls for a day or two. Dropped my phone and broke the screen
25/09/2022, 22:24 - Munjaal: Oof
25/09/2022, 22:27 - Dhaani: Using my work laptop. Thankfully whatsapp was logged in.
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Munjaal: Lucky
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Dhaani: Haan
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Munjaal: If you've got earphones you should be able to attend WhatsApp calls from the laptop
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Dhaani: Also, earlier in the evening, I called things off with Mithun earlier today.
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Munjaal: What why ?
25/09/2022, 22:29 - Munjaal: Wait
25/09/2022, 22:30 - Munjaal: Connect your earphones
25/09/2022, 22:30 - Dhaani: But then now I am staying at his for the night because we were at a mall when I dropped my phone and, given my current health state, not being able to even order food or book cabs, having no means of calling up, it didn't make sense for me to stay alone. 
To be fair, we were still interacting as friends and going shopping for a few things at forum after the calling off conversation. So this isn't too awkward.
25/09/2022, 22:30 - Munjaal: Okay
25/09/2022, 22:31 - Dhaani: This is whatsapp on browser.
25/09/2022, 22:31 - Munjaal: Oh
25/09/2022, 22:31 - Dhaani: No calls possible.
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Munjaal: Take rest for now, you're not well
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Dhaani: Hmmm
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Munjaal: Install any calling application (Skype, discord, duo) tomorrow if you can
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Dhaani: This is work laptop.
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Dhaani: I'll figure something by tomorrow to call.
25/09/2022, 22:32 - Munjaal: Okay
25/09/2022, 22:33 - Munjaal: Fyi: discord works from the browser
25/09/2022, 22:33 - Dhaani: I'll call tomorrow once I am home.
25/09/2022, 22:34 - Munjaal: Haan no rush
25/09/2022, 22:34 - Munjaal: Take rest first
25/09/2022, 22:34 - Dhaani: Will do
25/09/2022, 22:36 - Dhaani: It is a bit of a rough day.
25/09/2022, 22:37 - Munjaal: Understandable
25/09/2022, 23:11 - Dhaani: Trying to be normal since I am here.
25/09/2022, 23:12 - Dhaani: Kinda want a hug.
25/09/2022, 23:16 - Munjaal: I could really use one too
25/09/2022, 23:21 - Munjaal: <Media omitted>
25/09/2022, 23:31 - Dhaani: This is adorable
25/09/2022, 23:31 - Dhaani: What happened?
26/09/2022, 00:04 - Munjaal: Nothing really. Nothing has to happen for me to occasionally want a hug 😛
26/09/2022, 03:09 - Dhaani: 😅
26/09/2022, 03:13 - Munjaal: Why are you up ?
26/09/2022, 04:48 - Munjaal: https://youtu.be/6eCeS8PLcZE
26/09/2022, 19:05 - Munjaal: Hey
26/09/2022, 19:06 - Munjaal: Just done
26/09/2022, 19:06 - Munjaal: Was an extended meeting cause of an upcoming competition
26/09/2022, 19:25 - Dhaani: Oh ok
26/09/2022, 19:33 - Munjaal: Hey, what was your GMAT score ?
26/09/2022, 19:33 - Munjaal: Around 690 iirc
26/09/2022, 19:33 - Dhaani: 760
26/09/2022, 19:34 - Munjaal: Oh okay, thanks
26/09/2022, 19:36 - Dhaani: Kyun?
26/09/2022, 19:48 - Munjaal: Adi was asking since he wanted to know what approx score is needed

15/01/2023, 00:13 - Munjaal: Rewrite If by Rudyard Kipling but make it dark and nihilistic 

It's not the load that breaks us down
But the weight of what we've found
That life is but a fleeting breath
And all our struggles lead to death

We strive and fight, we toil and sweat
But in the end, it's all for naught
For fate will come, and claim us all
Leaving nothing but our fading thought

So if you can face each day with dread
And see the futility of it all
If you can force your heart and nerve
To serve your turn long after fall

If you can bear to hear the truth
That all your efforts will come to naught
And stoop to face the bitter end
With nothing but a bitter thought

Yours is the earth and everything that's in it
And—which is more—you'll be a man, my son

16/05/2023, 20:22 - Dhaani: How are you?
16/05/2023, 20:22 - Munjaal: Details
16/05/2023, 20:22 - Dhaani: What's up?
16/05/2023, 20:22 - Dhaani: The new engineering manager. The one that I thought is just really particular
16/05/2023, 20:23 - Dhaani: Apparently he has been going out of his way to put me down in the organisation
16/05/2023, 20:23 - Dhaani: My new manager showed me the chat
16/05/2023, 20:23 - Dhaani: Like it looks personal.
16/05/2023, 20:23 - Munjaal: But .... Why ? What does he gain again ?
16/05/2023, 20:23 - Dhaani: Going out of his way to ensure no one acknowledges improved performance on my end.
16/05/2023, 20:24 - Dhaani: My new manager actually brought it up with the product lead saying that if this guy is overexpecting 
Like you can't expect lead PM or senior PM level work from an APM.
16/05/2023, 20:24 - Dhaani: That that's just setting me up for failure.
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Dhaani: He just wants to work with senior PM
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Dhaani: Or push the blame from engineering to product entirely and wash his hands of this product set.
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Munjaal: At least someone has your back
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Munjaal: In the org
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Dhaani: Finally
16/05/2023, 20:25 - Dhaani: But this is ridiculous

16/05/2023, 20:26 - Munjaal: No headache at least with the internal politics

16/05/2023, 20:26 - Dhaani: Exactly
16/05/2023, 20:26 - Dhaani: This place is toxic
16/05/2023, 21:17 - Dhaani: It really dragged me doen today
16/05/2023, 21:21 - Munjaal: Once you quit the org, have a one on one conversation with him
16/05/2023, 21:21 - Munjaal: Bhai chahta kya hai life me ?
16/05/2023, 21:22 - Munjaal: You must look like his ex or something for him to be this vindictive
